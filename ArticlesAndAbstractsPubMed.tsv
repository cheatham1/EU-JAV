 cardiovascular diseases account for the highest mortality rate worldwide and are expected to be the major cause of death by 2020 ( 1 ) .
studies in iran showed that cardiovascular diseases are the most important cause of death and accounted for 42% of all deaths in 2002 ( 2 ) .
timely diagnosis and proactive measures play a significant role in effective treatment , prevention development of heart damages and the faster recovery of cardiovascular diseases . the time it takes to reach a hospital or a coronary care unit ( ccu ) and the time spent for diagnostic and treatment measures are factors influencing the delay or loss of time from the outset of severe cardiac infarction to the beginning of treatment ( 3 ) .
overall , the mortality rate of severe cardiovascular deaths is 30% , more than half of which occurs before hospitalization ( 3 ) . 
 

however , with the advancement of the epidemic this social trend reverses and people at lower socio - economic classes become more vulnerable ( 3 ) .
studies conducted in some developing countries showed that the underprivileged are more susceptible to cardiac arrests compared to affluent people ( 4 ) . furthermore , limited accessibility to health services and the inequality in availability of the services furnished by health and treatment systems deprives these people of acceptable and effective treatment ( 5 ) .
limited and unequal accessibility to health services in iran are one of the controversial issues mentioned in several studies ( 5 - 7 ) . 
 
 in general , one of the most important goals of a health system is to provide public accessibility and equality in receiving health and treatment services .
as one measure of development , accessibility to health is one of the basic rights of individuals in the society .
one of the main points in meting out fairness in the health system is that the distribution of health services must not be based on the socio - economic status and incomes of individuals ( 8) . 
 

inequality in health services in different countries has taken the form of a global challenge affected by various factors , including individual , social , economic and geographical variables ( 9 ) .
these factors are stronger in developing countries ( 8,10 ) so that distribution of health services resources in developing countries has turned into a fundamental issue .
therefore , the measurement of fair distribution of health services on top of previous measures has been emphasized by world health organization ( who ) ( 11 ) . 
 
 inequality in distribution of health services is measured by different scales one of the most common is the gini coefficient which is based on the lorenz curve ( 12 ) .
although multiple measures of inequality have been shown to be highly correlated with each other ( 7,12 ) , the results of several studies are encouraging and confirming the utility of the gini index in quantifying inequalities in health - related subjects .
thus , the gini index and lorenz curve are commonly used in analyzing the inequality in distribution of health care resources ( 13 - 16 ) . 
 

since accessibility to intensive healthcare , in particular for cardiovascular conditions , is of utmost importance and since the appropriate distribution of coronary care unit ( ccu ) beds and cardiologists can be taken as a measure , the present study aims to examine the inequality of the geographical distribution of ccu beds and cardiologists in iran using the gini coefficient and the lorenz curve . 


 this study conducted useing demographic data from national census in 2012 collected by the statistics center of iran ( sci ) .
the number of ccu beds and cardiologists in public sector by province in 2012 was obtained from iran ministry of health and medical education . 
 
 in the present study among various possible inequality measures ( such as gini coefficient , decile ratio , robin hood index and atkinson index ) preference
was given to the gini coefficient because it has at least three major advantages ( 17 ) .
first , it is less sensitive to the number of regions and the size of the numerical values in the data material in general .
third , gini coefficient can be presented visually by means of a lorenz curve ; which provides an effective visualization of the inequalities . 
 

the lorenz curve compares the distribution of a given variable with the normal distribution ( of same variable ) that represents equality .
the grater gap between the lorenz curve and diagonal line means the higher inequality . in this curve
, the x axis represents the cumulative percentage of population and the y axis shows the percentage of the variable which is expressed as the proportion of the cumulative population .
the 45-degree line is called the equality line because of showing the completely equal distribution ( 5 ) . in our study
, the x axis represents the cumulative percentage of population of iranian provinces and the y axis shows the cumulative frequency of cardiologists and ccu beds in the iranian provinces . 
 

the gini coefficient is defined as the division of the area between diagonal line and the lorenz curve ( 14 ) .
mathematically speaking , 
 
 g1=1k=1n(xkxk1)(yk+yk1 ) 
 
 where x represents the cumulative percentage of the population and y represents the cumulative percentage of ccu beds and cardiologists .
the gini coefficient ranges between 0 and 1 in which , theoretically , 0 represents complete equality and 1 shows complete inequality of the distribution of a given variable . in practice , however , a coefficient below 0.2 is considered complete equality , one ranging between 0.2 and 0.3 shows high equality , one ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 indicates inequality ; a coefficient varying between 0.4 and 0.6 indicates high inequality and a coefficient larger than 0.6 represents complete inequality ( 14 ) . 
 

in this study it is assumed that more cardiologist and ccu beds are associated with more access to cardiovascular health services , so that people in provinces with higher per capital level of cardiologist and ccu beds have more access to cardiovascular health resources / services . 
 

finally , in order to calculate gini coefficient , the demographic data and also the number of ccu beds and cardiologists by province were entered and analyzed through ms excel software . 


 in 2012 , iran had a total population of 75,149,669 with total number of 3665 ccu beds and the total number of 953 cardiologists in public sector .
the province of tehran had the largest percentage of ccu beds ( 23.7% ) and cardiologists ( 17% ) .
there were respectively 4.8 and 1.3 ccu beds and cardiologists across the nation per 100,000 individuals .
table 1 shows the number of cardiologists and ccu beds per 100,000 individuals and the number of cardiologists per 10 ccu beds by province in 2012 . 
 

the lorenz curves for the ccu beds and cardiologists are illustrated in figures 1 and2 .
the gini coefficients obtained for ccu beds and cardiologists were 0.129 and 0.045 , respectively . 


 the findings showed that the national mean number of ccu beds for a population of 100,000 is 4.88 , which 23 ( out of a total of 31 ) provinces are below the national mean .
however , the obtained gini coefficients prove statically adequate equality for the geographical distribution of ccu beds across iran .
a previous study showed that the province of yazd enjoys the most equal distribution of ccu beds on one hand , and the province of ilam suffers from the least equal distribution of ccu beds ( 16 ) .
a study on distribution of active hospital bed in iran , reported the gini coefficient for active bed 0.08 and active beds for a population of 10,000 people in 2006 9.2 , while the province of yazd had maximum , and the province of lorestan the minimum beds per population ( 18 ) .
another study conducted in 2002 using morris imbalance coefficient , showed the province of yazd stands at the highest rank in terms of the number of hospital beds , and the province of semnan ranks the highest in terms of the number of health centers ( 19 ) . 
 
 a study conducted in the  netherlands on the distribution of ccu beds in 24 university hospitals for the period 2004 - 2006 reported gini coefficients of 0.638 , 0.569 and 0.569 , which reflected unequal distribution ( 20 ) . a study conducted at 2006 reflects equal distribution of non - cardiac intensive care beds in iran .
the numbers of icu , post icu and nicu beds per 100,000 individuals in iran reported 5.3 , 0.4 and 1.6 , respectively and the gini coefficient for icu , post icu and nicu beds 0.17 , 0.15 and 0.23 ( 14 ) .
another study conducted at 2011 showed high degree of inequality in the distribution of kidney transplant beds in iran .
the province of tehran had more than half of the beds installed in its hospitals while 17 provinces had no kidney transplant beds at all ( 5 ) . in south africa , there were 4,168 icu beds counted in 2005 of which 86% were installed in three provinces .
the proportion of bed varied greatly in different provinces of this country , from 1:20,000 to 1:80,000 ( 21 ) .
the distribution of secondary and tertiary health services in the palestine is also reported to be unequal , mostly concentrated in the downtown . in the gaza strip and in the eastern
strip the proportions of iu beds per 1,000 were 1.4 and 1.2 , respectively ( 22 ) . in another study in the u.s.a the trend of gini coefficient during 1970 - 1997 was used to measure the distribution of hospital beds .
the northern states have been reported to enjoy an equal distribution of hospital beds ( 15 ) . 
 
lorenz curve of ccu beds in 2012 lorenz curve of cardiologists in 2012 
 the present study findings showed that the mean number of cardiologists per 100,000 individuals is 1.27 .
also , the mean number of cardiologists per 10 ccu is 2.6 which 13 provinces are below the national mean ( out of a total of 31 provinces ) .
the obtained gini coefficient ( 0.045 ) proves statically adequate equality in the geographical distribution of cardiologists across iran .
a study conducted on the distribution of specialist physicians in iran at 2010 showed that the numbers of total specialists per 10,000 individuals and per 10 active beds in the country were 1.7 and 1.9 , respectively and the gini coefficient of distribution of total specialists reported 0.052 ( 18 ) .
the gini coefficient was used in a study at 2000 to measure the resource distribution in mental health services in the us , showing the gini coefficient for psychologists as 0.13 ( 15 ) . in another study in japan gini coefficient
was used to measure equality in geographical distribution of orthopedic services ; findings showed the orthopedist per 100,000 individuals was 4.3 and the gini coefficient reported 0.36 ( 23 ) . 
 

the low gini coefficients obtained in this study suggest that the health system in iran has been relatively successful in establishing a fair geographical distribution of coronary care services , which can be attributed to the implementation of the fair national health services distribution strategic plan .
iran is the first east mediterranean country to implement this strategic health plan as its fourth development plan and through iran s 20-year vision plan in the health services department ( 24 ) .
furthermore , in a 1992 comprehensive program , the health services classification system was developed in order to avoid unnecessary parallel activities , create fairness in the distribution of inpatient health services , make accessible the health services to all people across the country , reduce the number of unused beds and develop a health services classification system on the basis of different specialties and their respective stations by province .
variables such as patient admission , population , mean hospital stay length , national divisions , available facilities and the geographical situation ( in terms of route and accessibility ) were determining factors in locating health centers ( 24,25 )
for instance , the maximum accessibility time to a ccu bed is set at 30 minutes .
therefore , if the temporal distance of a province to the next level of numerical reference shows a time length longer than 30 minutes , the calculated beds , which may even be below the installation basis , would belong to that province and would not be transferred ( 26 ) .
reports show that in the 2006 - 2007 687 ccu beds were installed in iran , indicating the iranian health system approach to promote health and create the conditions for the fair accessibility of health systems to all citizens ( 27 ) . 
 

our study descriptive statistics showed a skewed distribution of ccu beds in iran , so that the capital tehran , accommodating one sixth of the total population of iran , owns one fourth of total ccu beds in iran . in a similar study by ameryoun et al . on the non - cardiac intensive care beds in tehran the ratios of all non - cardiac intensive care beds were almost two times higher than other provinces ( 14 ) . also , in another study by tofighi et al . on the distribution of specialists , tehran owns 23% of all specialists across the country ( 18 ) .
however , a study conducted in 2002 ( 19 ) showed that by morris measure , the health centers in tehran do not constitute a balanced distribution , burdened with problems such as traffic jams and other problems rampant in metropolitan cities , causing delays and waste of time from the beginning of acute myocardial infarction symptoms to the initiation of treatment ( accessibility to the ccu bed ) .
furthermore , problems such as overcrowded hospitals in tehran , a drop in quality and quantity of health services , inadequacy of services on one hand and waste of funds for the provinces and finally a drop in public health on the other hand are other problems plaguing megacities .
therefore , health policy makers should emphasize decentralization in tehran and identify extra health facilities in different cities so that a balanced allocation of resources may be achieved . 
 

fair geographical distribution of health services would lead to efficient and cost - effective health system . while existing classificatory models in iran focus on structural development , the number of beds and a model of providing health services , few studies have concentrated on the distribution by area , classification and defining areas on the basis of optimal distribution of health services ( 26 ) .
therefore , current study may provide a foundation for large - scale planning for the health systems in order to remove the inequality in the distribution of health services .
further research and surveys are strongly recommended to acquire more information and monitor the fairness of distribution of different health systems nationally and across provinces . 
 

the aforementioned results represent an initial empirical approximation , the validity of which is limited for the following reasons .
first , counting the number of cardiologists and ccu beds is not an appropriate way to measure extant cardiovascular care and access to it ( a more sufficient reliable measure in iran is not available yet ) .
second , the methodology used to measure inequality is not perfect and biased with limitations in measuring inequality ; for example ,  utilizing the gini coefficient showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran , though , primary information on the distribution of beds and cardiologists showed that about one - fourth of the ccu beds are existed in tehran , where one - sixth of the total population of iran is living  .
such interpretations are helpful for providing an approximation of existing distributions and can show some limitations of using inequality measures . 
 
 despite the fact that the present study is one of the few studies conducted on the geographical distribution of one health services ( cardiovascular health services ) in iran , selecting only two factors ( the number of beds and physicians in the distribution of facilities ) and administering only one measure ( the gini coefficient )
may be considered as the limitations of this study . also , because of the unavailability of private sector and province - specific data , the research did not consider the private sector capacity and could not produce detailed provincial results , which are hoped to be overcome in future studies . measuring equality in distribution of private sector resources or all the private and public resources together could have extremely different results . 


 using gini measure showed that there is no significant inequality in the distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran .
nevertheless , our descriptive statistics showed that there is a skewness in distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran .
moreover , even the equal distribution of cardiovascular health facilities such as ccu beds , does not mean they are sufficiently provided in iran . 
"	" 
 background : timely access to cardiovascular health services is necessary to prevent heart damages . 
 the present study examined inequality in geographical distribution of cardiovascular health services in iran . 

 
 methods : present study is a cross - sectional study conducted using demographic data from all iranian provinces ( 31 provinces ) from 2012 census by the statistics center of iran ( sci ) . 
 the gini coefficients of ccu beds 
 and cardiologists were used to assess equality in access to cardiovascular health services in iran . 
 ms excel 
 software was used to calculate gini coefficients . 

 
 results : the proportions of ccu bed and cardiologist per 100,000 population were 4.88 and 1.27 , respectively ; also the gini coefficients were 0.129 and 0.045 , respectively . 

 
 conclusion : descriptive statistics showed a skewness in distribution of pubic cardiovascular health services in iran , though gini coefficient revealed no significant inequality . 
 however , equal distribution of ccu beds and cardiovascular specialists does not mean they are sufficiently available in iran .

3	"results of a liquid culturing system ( bd bactec mgit 960 system ; bd diagnostics , sparks , md , us ) ( for details , see the technical appendix ) showed that all 5 beijing and 5 eai genotype strains were susceptible to isoniazid ( inh ) , rifampin ( rif ) , moxifloxacin ( mxf ) , and amikacin ( amk ) .
mics were determined by using the agar proportion method ( 11 ) , which showed that ranges were small for the beijing and eai genotype strains : inh , 0.0620.125 mg / l ; rif , 0.1251 mg / l ; mxf , 0.1250.5 mg / l ; and amk , 0.52 mg / l .
we determined the mutation frequencies of the beijing and eai genotype strains by using previously defined critical drug concentrations of 1 mg / l for inh , rif , and mxf and 5 mg / l for amk ( 11,12 ) ( for details , see the technical appendix ) .
the mutation frequencies of the beijing and eai genotype strains were similar for inh , mxf , and amk , but they were significantly different for rif ( 1.6  10 to 5.4  10 for beijing strains vs. 6.3  10 to 3.8  10 for eai strains ; p = 0.003 , unpaired mann - whitney test ) ( table 1 ; figure 1 ) . because rifamycin drugs are widely used to treat tb , the difference in the mutation frequencies of beijing and eai genotype strains for rif is a major finding .
frequency of rifampin ( rif)-resistant mutants in mycobacterium tuberculosis beijing and east - african / indian ( eai ) genotype strains ( 5 strains each ) originating from vietnam .
statistical analysis was performed by using an unpaired mann - whitney test . for beijing genotype strains ,
the increase in mutation frequency during exposure to rif could be due to described missense mutations in the mut genes ( 13 ) .
such mutations in the mut genes can change the dna repair mechanism ; as a consequence , the frequency of resistant mutant formation might increase . however , a direct correlation between the occurrence of particular mutations in mut genes and altered mutation frequency has not been proven .
furthermore , werngren and hoffner ( 14 ) found an equal mutation frequency for beijing ( 3.6  10 ) and non - beijing ( 4.4  10 ) genotypes . a possible explanation for the discrepancy in findings might be the concentration of rif used in the subculture plates . in our study ,
the critical concentration of 1 mg / l rif was used ( 11 ) , whereas werngren and hoffner used a concentration of 2 mg / l rif .
in addition , werngren and hoffner compared the beijing and non - beijing genotypes of several genotype families , whereas we compared beijing and eai genotype strains that were selected from the same tuberculosis - endemic area and during the same period .
we determined the time - kill kinetics of rif toward 2 strains with significantly different mutation frequencies : beijing-1585 ( 3.7  10 [ 3.0  10 and 4.3  10 , duplicates ] ) and eai-1627 ( 3.5  10 [ 2.8  10 and 4.1  10 , duplicates ] ) .
cultures with low and high densities of beijing-1585 and eai-1627 were investigated as described ( 15 ) .
rif showed strong time- and concentration - dependent activity toward low - density cultures of the 2 strains ( figure 2 ) .
low concentrations of rif were needed to achieve > 99% mycobacterial killing ; differences between beijing-1585 and eai-1627 were minor ( table 2 ) .
however , to achieve 100% killing , especially for beijing-1585 , rif concentrations had to be increased substantially ( table 2 ) .
compared with the low - density culture for beijing-1585 , a substantial increase in rif concentrations was needed to achieve 100% killing of the high - density culture ( table 2 ) .
this finding may be relevant in the clinical context because high - density mycobacteria populations are expected to exist in infected tissues of tb patients .
concentration- and time - dependent bactericidal effect of rifampin ( rif ) toward low - density cultures of mycobacterium tuberculosis be-1585 ( 5.1  10 cfu / ml ) ( a ) and m. tuberculosis eai-1627 ( 6.8  10 cfu / ml ) ( b ) .
after 1 , 3 , or 6 days of exposure , subcultures were performed on solid media to count cfus . *
accurate cfu counting could not be performed  because complete outgrowth of mycobacteria occurred on the sixth day of rif exposure , leading to aggregation .
* cultures were exposed to rif at 2-fold increasing concentrations for 6 days at 37c ; at indicated time - points , subcultures were performed on solid media for counting .
low , low - density culture ; high , high - density culture ; nd ,  not determined . 
rif - resistant mutants did not emerge in low - density cultures of beijing-1585 and eai-1627 .
however , rif - resistant mutants were selected at relatively high numbers from high - density beijing-1585 cultures compared with high - density eai-1627 cultures . in beijing-1585 cultures ,
exposure to rif concentrations of 232 mg / l selected resistant mutants only ; this was not observed in eai-1627 cultures .
analysis of rif - resistant beijing mutants showed the following altered rpob gene sequences : cacgac ( h526d ) , cactac ( h526y ) , and tcgttg ( s531l ) , as assessed by using the genotype mtbdrplus ( hain lifescience , nehren , germany ) assay ( for details , see the technical appendix ) . for 3 of the 4 anti - tb drugs ,
the difference in the range of mutant prevention concentrations for the beijing and eai genotype strains was small : inh , 128256 mg / l ; rif , 2561,024 mg / l ; and mxf , 28 mg / l .
we showed that the currently used anti - tb drug susceptibility assays do not discriminate between the in vitro susceptibility , as determined by the methods used in this study , of the m. tuberculosis beijing and eai genotype strains .
we also showed that the determination of mutation frequencies might be more informative than results of anti - tb drug susceptibility assays .
for rif , mutation frequencies in beijing genotype strains were high compared with those in eai genotype strains , and the selection of rif - resistant mutants among beijing strains , but not eai strains , occurred within a wide range of rif concentrations . in addition , the killing capacity of rif toward the beijing genotype is dependent on the density of mycobacteria : high concentrations of rif are required to achieve 100% killing of high - density beijing genotype populations but not of high - density eai genotype populations .
these in vitro characteristics might contribute to the less favorable treatment outcome of beijing genotype tb infections and their significant association with drug resistance .
our findings demonstrate the need for anti - tb drug treatments that will prevent resistance among m. tuberculosis beijing genotype tb cases , and they suggest that the development of genotype - specific tb therapy might be justified .

" to determine differences in the ability of mycobacterium tuberculosis strains to withstand antituberculosis drug treatment , we compared the activity of antituberculosis drugs against susceptible beijing and east - african / indian genotype m. tuberculosis strains . 
 beijing genotype strains showed high rates of mutation within a wide range of drug concentrations , possibly explaining this genotype s association with multidrug - resistant tuberculosis . "	"The Study

5	"treatment with statins is highly effective in primary and secondary cardiovascular disease prevention , but their use can be associated with a variety of adverse effects , mainly affecting the muscles and liver .
the most frequent symptom is myalgia , which occurs in 1015% of patients treated with statins . in primary prevention ,
up to 25.4% of patients stop taking statins by 6 months after the beginning of treatment . for patients who can not tolerate statin therapy ,
statins inhibit the rate - limiting step in cholesterol synthesis through acting on the key enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme a ( hmgcoa ) reductase .
besides inhibiting the synthesis of cholesterol , biosynthesis of coenzyme q10 is also reduced , since coenzyme q10 is an intermediate in the mevalonate pathway .
statins were shown to reduce serum / plasma levels of coenzyme q10 by 1654% and coenzyme q10 supplementation was reported to increase the levels of coenzyme q10 in plasma .
coenzyme q10 , also known as ubiquinone , is localized in cellular membranes and participates in electron transport , and during oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria , protects against oxidative stress and regenerates active forms of the antioxidant vitamin e .
deficiency of coenzyme q10 affects oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) production , and consequently impairs muscle energy metabolism .
therefore , a deficiency of coenzyme q10 is the most probable mechanism of statin - related myopathy [ 79 ] .
if the proposed mechanism of statin - related muscle pain is at least partially correct , coenzyme q10 supplementation seems a logical step in its reduction .
several previous studies have reported conflicting results regarding decrease of statin - related muscle pain by coenzyme q10 supplementation in different study populations [ 6,1113 ] .
therefore , the aim of the present study was to test whether coenzyme q10 supplementation could decrease mild - to - moderate statin - associated muscle pain .
the specifics of the chosen group represent one of the most frequent clinical scenarios in statin - related adverse effects .
fifty patients of both sexes , aged between 40 and 65 years , with statin - related muscle pain were recruited in this study .
important inclusion criteria were the use of a statin for more than 6 months and the presence of statin - associated muscular symptoms for at least 6 months . in all enrolled patients , before the inclusion to the study , all possible efforts to decrease symptoms and to identify possible association with statin use were made as follows : gradual decreases of statin dose , de - challenge and re - challenge of statin treatment , and switch to another statin .
where other possible identifiable causes of myopathy were suspected , patients were not eligible for enrollment . also , patients with serious medical conditions or any other specific disease ( e.g. , hepatic , vascular , renal , or endocrine ) or coagulopathy were excluded .
a neurologist and an orthopedist also excluded possible neurological and orthopedic reasons for muscle pain before the inclusion to the study .
this was a double - blind , placebo - controlled study with balanced randomization ( 1:1 ) . an independent pharmacist ,
who was not clinically involved in the study , packed containers with either placebo or q10 ( mgc company , japan ) and numbered them according to a simple randomization procedure ( computerized random numbers ) .
the substances , placebo or q10 , were in the form of tablets identical in appearance , packed in the same white , opaque containers .
the key to the content of each numbered container was stored in the safe deposit box of the pharmacist .
each participant was assigned an order number and received the corresponding prepacked container according to the simple randomization procedure .
the allocation sequence obtained was concealed in a sealed envelope from the researchers enrolling and assessing participants .
the control group ( n=25 ) received placebo , and the q10 group ( n=25 ) received coenzyme q10 supplementation over a period of 30 days .
the patients were recruited at the department of vascular diseases , university of ljubljana medical center .
they reported myopathic symptoms consisting of muscle pain per se or accompanied by other symptoms , such as muscle weakness , muscle fatigue , or both .
a definition of mild - to - moderate muscle symptoms was used , representing the pain severity score ( pss ) or pain interference score ( pis ) of 26 .
the study protocol was approved by the national medical ethics committee of slovenia and informed consent was obtained from all the patients .
enrolled patients were assessed in 2 separate visits : at the beginning and at the end of the study ( i.e. , day 0 and day 30 of the study ) . on the first visit , a clinical examination of each subject was performed and each subject completed a brief pain inventory ( bpi ) questionnaire for evaluation of myopathic symptoms before intervention .
the questionnaire consisted of 2 parts : a pain severity score ( pss ) , calculated by averaging scores of the 4 pain intensity categories and a pain interference score ( pis ) , computed by averaging values of the 7 interference items from the questionnaire .
a blood sample was also obtained for the following laboratory analyses : fasting plasma lipid profile ( total cholesterol , low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol , and triglycerides ) , creatine kinase ( ck ) concentration , and liver function enzymes ( transaminases and gamma - glutamyl transpeptidase ) .
patients were then randomly assigned to receive either coenzyme q10 supplementation ( a daily supplement consisting of 50 mg of water - soluble coenzyme q10 twice daily ) or placebo twice daily for 30 days .
their assigned statin therapy was continued during the course of the study . on the second visit after completion of supplementation therapy ,
myopathic symptoms were re - evaluated with the bpi questionnaire and another blood sample was obtained for the above - listed laboratory analyses .
intragroup differences in q10 and placebo groups from the beginning to the end of the supplementation period were assessed by the paired t test .
intergroup comparisons of relative changes ( before / after study ) between q10 and placebo group were assessed by the t test .
power analysis for the difference between the placebo and the q10 groups for the pain severity score ( pss ) and pain interference score ( pis ) was conducted .
parameters needed for the power analysis  the difference between groups and standard deviations  were estimated from the sample .
a power of 99.1% and 98.5% was achieved when pis and pss , respectively , were used as a response .
fifty patients of both sexes , aged between 40 and 65 years , with statin - related muscle pain were recruited in this study .

their assigned statin therapy was continued during the course of the study . on the second visit after completion of supplementation therapy ,
myopathic symptoms were re - evaluated with the bpi questionnaire and another blood sample was obtained for the above - listed laboratory analyses .
intragroup differences in q10 and placebo groups from the beginning to the end of the supplementation period were assessed by the paired t test .
intergroup comparisons of relative changes ( before / after study ) between q10 and placebo group were assessed by the t test .
all statistical analyses were performed using graph pad prism 5.0 and spss 15.0 software . power analysis for the difference between the placebo and the q10 groups for the pain severity score ( pss ) and pain interference score ( pis )
parameters needed for the power analysis  the difference between groups and standard deviations  were estimated from the sample .
a power of 99.1% and 98.5% was achieved when pis and pss , respectively , were used as a response .
fifty patients were enrolled in the study , of whom 25 received coenzyme q10 and 25 received placebo .
nineteen patients received statin therapy in secondary prevention and 31 in primary prevention . in patients who received statin in secondary prevention ,
intensive dose reduction was not performed and statin discontinuation lasted for a short time ( not more than for 2 weeks ) .
patient characteristics at inclusion in the study are summarized in table 1 and did not differ between groups .
the distribution of types of statin among the patients was as follows : 22 patients received rosuvastatin 1020 mg daily , 20 patients received atorvastatin ( 10 patients 40 mg daily , and 10 patients 1020 mg daily ) , 4 patients received simvastatin 1020 mg daily , 3 patients received fluvastatin 80 mg daily , and 1 patient received lovastatin 20 mg daily . at inclusion in the study ,
the intensity of myopathic pain , measured as the pain severity score ( pss ) , was similar in both groups ( placebo and q10 group ) .
intragroup comparison showed that after 30 days of intervention , the intensity of myopathic pain in the q10 group was significantly reduced , from 3.90.4 to 2.90.4 ( p<0.001 ) , but there was no significant change in myopathic pain intensity in the placebo group ( figure 1a ) . when comparing the percentage of change between the groups ( intergroup comparison )
, we found that the intensity of myopathic pain was significantly reduced after 30 days of intervention in the q10 group compared to the placebo group ( 33.15.7% and 0.46.3% , respectively ; both p<0.05 ) .
interference of pain with daily activities was measured as the pain interference score ( pis ) . at inclusion in the study ,
intragroup comparison showed that after q10 intervention , pis was significantly reduced , from 4.00.4 to 2.60.4 ( p<0.001 ) . in the placebo group ,
the pis did not change significantly ( figure 1b ) . when comparing the percentage of change between the groups ( intergroup comparison )
, we found that the intensity of myopathic pain was significantly reduced after 30 days of intervention in the q10 group compared to the placebo group ( 40.37.0% and 11.510.2% , respectively ; both p<0.05 ) .
the results of the biochemical analyses made at the beginning and at the end of the study are presented in table 2 .
there were no differences in liver and muscle enzymes or cholesterol levels in the q10 or placebo groups during the course of the study ( intragroup comparison ) ( table 2 ) .
fifty patients were enrolled in the study , of whom 25 received coenzyme q10 and 25 received placebo .

the results of the biochemical analyses made at the beginning and at the end of the study are presented in table 2 .
there were no differences in liver and muscle enzymes or cholesterol levels in the q10 or placebo groups during the course of the study ( intragroup comparison ) ( table 2 ) .
in the present study , the possible beneficial effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation on mild - to - moderate statin - related muscle symptoms were studied , since this is one of the most frequent reasons for statin therapy withdrawal .
we found that supplementation with coenzyme q10 ( 50 mg twice daily for 30 days ) reduced muscle pain and produced less interference by pain with daily life activities .
overall , coenzyme q10 supplementation decreased statin - related muscle symptoms in 75% of patients .
we observed no significant effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation on liver and muscle enzymes , which were within normal ranges during the course of the study in both treatment groups . also , cholesterol levels did not change significantly from the beginning to the end of the study .
the observed beneficial effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation could lead to better statin treatment compliance .
the present study was designed as a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trial to evaluate the possible beneficial effect of coenzyme q10 supplementation ( 50 mg twice daily for 30 days ) on statin - associated muscle pain .
a 30-day period was chosen because data in the literature indicate that the effect should reveal itself within that period . in its absence ,
extended supplementation is not recommended . using the standardized and simple brief pain inventory ( bpi ) questionnaire , consisting of a pain severity score ( pss ) and a pain interference score ( pis )
, we found that after 30 days with coenzyme q10 supplementation , muscle pain and the interference of pain with daily life activities in the mild - to - moderate symptom group were significantly reduced from the beginning to the end of the study ( from 3.90.4 to 2.90.4 and from 4.00.4 to 2.60.4 , respectively , both p<0.001 ) .
the relative values of pss and pis significantly decreased in the q10 group compared to placebo group ( 33.1 and 40.3% , respectively ; both p<0.05 ) , showing the effectiveness of q10 .
coenzyme q10 supplementation did not affect liver and muscle enzymes , which were in the normal ranges in both groups during the course of the study . according to the guidelines , all patients included in our study had myalgia 
muscle pain per se that could also be accompanied with other muscular symptoms such as muscle weakness , muscle fatigue , or both .
the levels of all cholesterols did not differ significantly before and after intervention in separate groups .
conflicting results of coenzyme q10 supplementation on statin - induced muscle pain were observed in previous studies .
the beneficial effects of coenzyme q10 were confirmed in 2 studies , but not in others .
reported that coenzyme q10 supplementation at a 200-mg daily dose ( twice that used in our study ) for 12 weeks did not improve myalgia in patients receiving simvastatin ( in a dosage of 1040 mg daily ) . in that study ,
the myalgia score was assessed by a visual analogue scale , which is known to be less accurate than the more complex brief pain inventory ( bpi ) questionnaire used in our study , and this could be the reason for the negative result observed .
similar results were observed in a study by bookstaver et al . , in which coenzyme q10 was supplemented in a dosage of 120 mg daily for 3 months .
it is also interesting that the intervals of observation were longer in both of these 2 studies compared to the present study . on the other hand ,
the most similar regimen to ours was in the study by caso et al . ,
in which the same dosage of coenzyme q10 was prescribed ( 100 mg daily ) and the bpi questionnaire was used to assess pain severity and pain interference with daily activities .
also , the duration of supplementation was the same . like our results , a decrease in both parameters was observed after 30 days of coenzyme q10 supplementation , but its major limitation was not being placebo - controlled . from that point of view , the results obtained in the present study have greater value and confirm the beneficial effect of coenzyme q10 supplementation . a recent study by fedacko et al
. showed that coenzyme q10 supplementation decreased symptoms of statin - associated myopathy , intensity of muscle pain , muscle weakness , muscle cramps , and muscle tiredness . considering all data from the above - mentioned studies together , we believe that the conflicting results show a complex relation between statin - related muscle symptoms and coenzyme q10 supplementation , probably due to the many confounding factors that influence the efficacy of coenzyme q10 supplementation .
the limitation of the present study was the relatively small number of patients involved , which consequently limits extensive generalization of the results obtained .
the main reason for the relatively small population group lay in the strict inclusion criteria , which ensured recruiting only patients with  real  statin - related muscular symptoms , who were highly motivated and informed , and consequently an accurate estimate of the intervention efficacy could be obtained .
specifically , over - subjective estimation of statin - associated muscular symptoms is a well - known problem , which could importantly affect the results and conclusions .
undoubtedly , further studies enrolling larger numbers of participants are warranted to address this problem .
importantly , patients with mild - to - moderate muscular symptoms were included , which is probably the most frequent clinical scenario in patients with statin - related symptoms .
furthermore , it is important to note that it was placebo - controlled and used widely accessible , relatively objective standardized questionnaires , allowing for great comparability . on the other hand
, we do not know whether the proposed therapy is effective in all patients with statin - associated symptoms , but according to our data , it should be effective in the mild - to - moderate statin - associated symptoms group .
the present study was patient - oriented and designed to focus on clinical effects of coenzyme q10 supplementation in statin - induced muscle symptoms , and not its mechanistic background .
therefore , the concentration of coenzyme q10 in plasma or muscles and possible mechanistic background ( e.g. , anti - inflammatory and anti - oxidative ) were not addressed in this study .
the present study revealed that by simple coenzyme q10 supplementation of the regular statin treatment , associated muscle pain in the mild - to - moderate symptoms group could be significantly reduced .
consequently , it may lead to lower interference with daily activities and higher compliance with statin treatment .
these observations mean a better quality of life , besides adequate cardiovascular protection , which is the primary goal of statin therapy .
the results of the present study are very promising , but require further testing in larger clinical trials , mainly to allow them to be generalized ."	" backgroundstatin use is frequently associated with muscle - related symptoms . 
 coenzyme q10 supplementation has yielded conflicting results in decreasing statin myopathy . herein , we tested whether coenzyme q10 supplementation could decrease statin - associated muscular pain in a specific group of patients with mild - to - moderate muscle symptoms.material/methodsfifty patients treated with statins and reporting muscle pain were recruited . 
 the q10 group ( n=25 ) received coenzyme q10 supplementation over a period of 30 days ( 50 mg twice daily ) , and the control group ( n=25 ) received placebo . 
 the brief pain inventory ( bpi ) questionnaire was used and blood testing was performed at inclusion in the study and after 30 days of supplementation.resultsthe intensity of muscle pain , measured as the pain severity score ( pss ) , in the q10 group was reduced from 3.90.4 to 2.90.4 ( p<0.001 ) . 
 the pain interference score ( pis ) after q10 supplementation was reduced from 4.00.4 to 2.60.4 ( p<0.001 ) . in the placebo group , pss and pis 
 did not change .

Discussion
Conclusions"
8	"following a clinically predictable progression 
 pattern , advanced 
 prostate cancer ( pca ) metastasizes to distant organs , with a striking 
 predisposition for bone . despite a decreasing 
 overall mortality rate for pca patients ,
the development 
 of effective treatments has been hindered , in part , by the lack of 
 cell lines and/or xenograft models that accurately recapitulate the 
 complex metastatic microenvironment . without appropriate 
 models to reflect the disease , mechanistic studies to accurately elucidate 
 the players involved in pca progression in bone have been difficult 
 to implement , impeding the development of clinically effective therapeutics 
 targeted to bone metastases .
some 
 of the more commonly used pca cell lines ( e.g. , pc-3 and du-145 ) 
 offer convenience to investigators because they adhere well to tissue 
 culture plastic and therefore are amenable to high throughput screening 
 of drug libraries .
however , these same cell lines , when inoculated 
 in bone , generate a largely osteolytic response , in contrast to the 
 predominantly osteoblastic nature of the native human disease .
to 
 more accurately model the disease , we have employed the lncap cell 
 line progression series ( lncap , c4 , c4 - 2 , and c4 - 2b ) , with c4 - 2b cells 
 forming osseous lesions in bone .
however , 
 we and other investigators continue to search for pca cell models 
 with greater fidelity to the disease that will foster the translation 
 of preclinical findings into the clinic , particularly to satisfy the 
 need to identify new treatments that will eradicate pca metastases 
 growing in bone . to address the need for the highest - possible 
 fidelity in pca cell 
 sources , patient - derived xenograft ( pdx ) models
have been established 
 for the preclinical investigation of various aspects of pca biology 
 including angiogenesis , identification of castrate - resistant stem - like 
 cells , and effect of anti - androgen therapies .
pdx models are generated when 
 tumor tissue from the patient is surgically resected and engrafted 
 directly into immunocompromised mice .
tumors 
 are subsequently maintained solely in vivo via mouse - to - mouse passage , 
 requiring both careful monitoring of the tumor burden and labor intensive 
 animal transfers . through serial passaging 
 in mice and the absence of any in vitro manipulation ,
pdx tumors remain 
 biologically stable , preserving much of the molecular , genetic , and 
 histological features as well as heterogeneity of the original tumor .
however , given the high costs of animal maintenance , 
 lengthy latency period following engraftment , variable engraftment 
 rates , and rare access to patient tissue specimens , pdx in vivo models 
 are generally not yet widely employed in cancer research .
most notably , given the poor viability exhibited 
 when grown in vitro under standard tissue culture conditions , it is 
 extremely challenging to culture pdx bone metastatic pca cells for 
 any brief ex vivo manipulation needed to conduct controlled mechanistic 
 studies in vivo .
mirroring the in vitro behavior of pdx prostate 
 tumors , pca cell 
 lines belonging to the lncap series also adhere poorly to two - dimensional 
 ( 2d ) tissue culture surfaces , precluding them from use in standard 
 drug screening platforms . to circumvent 
 this problem ,
our laboratory recently demonstrated the feasibility 
 of using three - dimensional ( 3d ) hyaluronan ( ha)-based hydrogel systems 
 to support the growth and viability of these pca cell lines for mechanistic 
 studies and drug testing . while the commonly employed human 
 tumor spheroid model is an alternative to culturing these poorly adherent 
 cells , hydrogel encapsulation provides the means to fully recapitulate 
 the tumor microenvironment with precise , tunable control over architectural 
 and mechanical cues and/or critical cell 
specifically , as a ubiquitous component of the bone marrow 
 where bone metastatic pca cells reside , ha plays an active role in 
 regulating several biological processes , including tumorigenesis , 
 strongly justifying its use as an extracellular matrix analogue for 
 culturing bone metastatic tumor cells in vitro . on the basis of the suitability of ha - based hydrogel 
 systems for 
 the culture of pca cell lines , we hypothesized that these systems 
 would similarly support the viability of pdx pca cells in vitro .
hence , 
 in the present study , we developed a novel protocol to encapsulate 
 pdx pca cells within 3d ha - based hydrogels and examined tumor cell 
 morphology , viability , proliferative capacity and phenotype .
we also 
 tested the potential of this 3d pdx pca model as a diagnostic platform 
 for evaluating rapid patient - specific drug response , a significant 
 advance toward achieving a more personalized therapeutic regimen .

this ha - sh / peg - da 
 hydrogel system previously has been characterized extensively .
dmso , l - cysteine , and papain papaya latex were obtained from sigma - aldrich 
 ( st . louis , mo ) .
primary antibodies used were human - specific anti - nuclei 
 antibody from millipore ( mab1281 , billerica , ma ) , anti - androgen receptor 
 from santa cruz biotechnology ( sc-816 , dallas , tx ) , anti - cleaved caspase-3 
 from cell signaling technology ( nb11089717 , danver , ma ) , and 
 anti - ki-67 from novus biologicals ( # 9664s , littleton , 
 co ) .
sylgard 184 poly(dimethylsiloxane ) ( pdms ) elastomer kit was from 
 dow corning ( midland , mi ) .
mda pca 183 
 and mda pca 118b cells 
 were routinely maintained as subcutaneous tumors in cb-17 scid mice 
 ( charles river ) .
all experiments for the propagation of pdx tumors 
 in mice were conducted under iacuc approval from the university of 
 texas md anderson cancer center .
the mda pca 183 xenograft was derived 
 from androgen - dependent prostate carcinoma , whereas the mda pca 118b 
 was derived from androgen receptor - negative castrate - resistant prostate 
 carcinoma . for this study ,
mda pca 183 
 and mda pca 118b pdxs of passage 12 and 8 respectively , were used . 
 on the day of harvest ,
tumor specimens were removed immediately , rinsed six 
 times with pbs , minced with a scalpel blade , and digested with accumax 
 enzymatic solution for 15 min at 37 c .
the enzyme solution was 
 inactivated with fbs , the resultant tumor slurry was filtered through 
 a 70 m cell strainer , and the filtrate was centrifuged .
the 
 supernatant was removed , the resulting cell pellet was resuspended , 
 and a cell count was performed .
custom - made pdms molds were made 
 by mixing sylgard 184 elastomer and cross - linker 10:1 ( v / v ) according 
 to manufacturer s instructions .
the liquid silicone solution 
 was centrifuged at 4 c/3000 rpm/5 min to remove bubbles and 
 poured into a square aluminum frame with a 1.5 mm - thick spacer .
an x-660 automated 
 co2 laser cutter ( universal laser systems , scottsdale , 
 az ) was used at 2.5% speed and 60% power to cut the slabs into 24 
  60 mm rectangles with multiple 6 mm diameter cylindrical cavities . 

the resultant molds were steam - autoclaved before each use and were 
 sealed onto sterile glass slides before being employed as molds for 
 hydrogel fabrication .
each cylindrical cavity could hold approximately 
 50 l of hydrogel . prior to pdx tumor culture
, ha - sh and 
 peg - da were solubilized at 10 and 20 mg / ml , respectively , in degassed 
 water per the manufacturer s instructions .
the solutions were 
 mixed at 4:1 ( v / v ) ratio , 35 l of the combined solution was 
 placed in each cavity of the silicone molds , and the mixture was allowed 
 to cross - link for 1 h at 37 c .
the bottom layer of acellular 
 hydrogel served as a  cushion layer  to prevent cell 
 clusters from settling out of the cell  hydrogel construct during 
 culture . following tumor harvest ,
were plated on 6-well plates at densities 
 determined to yield hydrogel constructs with 150,000 and 300,000 encapsulated 
 mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b cells respectively , per construct .
mda 
 pca 183 and mda pca 118b cells were cultured in dmem / f-12 supplemented 
 with 10% and 30% ( v / v ) fbs , respectively , in the presence of 100 u / ml 
 of penicillin and 100 g / ml of streptomycin . tumor cells then 
 were incubated at 37 c with 5% co2 for 2 days , after 
 which tumor cell aggregates that formed in suspension from all wells 
 were collected into sterile 15 ml tubes and gently centrifuged .
supernatant 
 was removed from each tube , and the remaining cell pellets were resuspended 
 in complete dmem / f-12 medium , combined , and split into microcentrifuge 
 tubes and centrifuged again .
notably , as these cells form clusters 
 in suspension , we could not perform cell counts immediately prior 
 to encapsulation . instead
, cell counting for the preparation of hydrogel 
 constructs was performed at the step of 2d culture in 6-well plates 
 ( immediately after the tumors were dissociated ) .
the resulting cell 
 pellets then were resuspended in solutions of ha - sh and peg - da ( 4:1 
 v / v ) as described above , and 25 l of the cell - hydrogel suspension 
 was immediately pipetted into each mold cavity , over the 35 l 
 cushion layer of cross - linked ha - sh / peg - da .
seeded hydrogels were 
 returned to the incubator for 45 min , then immersed in cell culture 
 medium and incubated overnight .
the following day , each mold cavity 
 was scored with a 26-gauge needle , cell - hydrogel constructs were transferred 
 into 24-well plates and submerged in culture medium .
the c4 - 2b bone metastatic 
 pca cell line was maintained in t - medium containing 5% fbs ( v / v ) and 
 2 mm l - glutamine in the presence of 100 u / ml of penicillin 
 and 100 g / ml of streptomycin .
for the docetaxel drug study , 
 50,000 cells were encapsulated within ha - sh / peg - da as described above 
 for the pdx tumors .
a lower cell density was used for the cell line 
 because high - density culture was associated with poor cell viability 
 ( data not shown ) .
cell - hydrogel constructs 
 ( n = 3 ) were maintained for 2 days before treatment 
 with docetaxel 
 for 3 days .
docetaxel was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) such 
 that the final concentration of dmso was 1% ( v / v ) in complete medium 
 across all drug concentrations .
morphology of the cells 
 encapsulated within 
 the hydrogel was monitored by differential interference contrast microscopy 
 at days 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 postencapsulation using a nikon eclipse te300 
 inverted microscope and nis elements software ( nikon instruments , 
 melville , ny ) .
fluorescently labeled samples were imaged using a nikon 
 a1-rsi confocal microscope and images processed using the nikon nis - elements 
 ar software ( nikon instruments , melville , ny ) .
cell viability was assessed using the 
 live / dead viability / cytotoxicity kit as per the manufacturer s 
 instructions .
briefly , cell - hydrogel constructs at the designated 
 time - points were incubated in 2 m calcein - am and 4 m 
 ethidium homodimer-1 in pbs for 30 min at 37 c before confocal 
 imaging .
cell - hydrogel constructs ( n = 3 or 4 ) were collected into individual microcentrifuge 
 tubes at the designated time - points , flash - frozen using liquid nitrogen , 
 and stored at 80 c .
frozen samples then were lyophilized 
 overnight and digested in pbe buffer ( 0.10 m na2hpo4 and 0.010 m na2edta in demineralized water at 
 ph 6.5 ) containing 125 g / ml papain in the presence of 14.5 
 mm l - cysteine at 65 c overnight .
the digested samples then were sonicated using a probe 
 sonicator , and the liquid supernatant was assayed using the quant - it 
 picogreen dsdna quantification assay as per the manufacturer s 
 instructions .
excitation and emission wavelengths of 485 and 528 nm , respectively , 
 were used to measure the fluorescence ( flx800 fluorescence microplate 
 reader ; biotek instruments ) .
cell - hydrogel constructs were washed 
 with pbs and fixed with 4% ( v / v ) paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room 
 temperature .
after fixation , constructs were washed with pbs and stored 
 at 4 c until staining .
constructs were immersed in 0.2% ( v / v ) 
 triton x-100 for 5 min at room temperature to permeabilize cells , 
 then blocked with 500 l of 3% ( w / v ) bsa and 0.2% triton x-100 
 in pbs at 4 c overnight .
all antibodies were diluted at 1:200 
 in 3% bsa and 0.2% triton - x-100 in pbs .
antibody staining was performed 
 using 200 l of the mixed solution to each sample , which were 
 placed on a rocking platform shaker at 4 c overnight .
samples 
 were washed with pbs before adding fluorophore - labeled secondary antibodies 
 directed against the appropriate host .
secondary antibodies were diluted 
 1:500 in 3% bsa and 0.2% triton - x-100 in pbs , and 200 l of 
 that solution was added to each sample .
dapi ( 5 g / ml ) 
 was added to each sample at room temperature for 5 min .
when phalloidin 
 was used , it was diluted 1:20 in pbs , and 100 l of that mixture 
 was added to each sample for 15 min .
in initial experiments , following tumor digestion , 
 we encapsulated the entire pdx cell population directly into hydrogels . 

when we did so , a large number of dead cells was transferred to the 
 hydrogels as observed after 1 day in 3d culture ( data not shown ) . 

these dead cells likely were generated during the tumor harvest and 
 digestion , and also contain mouse - derived cells that die immediately 
 within the hydrogels . as the presence of high numbers of dead cells 
 would complicate any biochemical assays that were envisioned , we sought 
 to develop an alternative procedure designed to encapsulate cells 
 with high viability ( figure 1a ) .
( a ) mda pca 
 183 and mda pca 118b pdx tumors ( indicated by red arrows ) that were 
 grown subcutaneously in scid mice were harvested , then mechanically 
 and enzymatically digested .
the tumor slurry was subsequently plated 
 onto 6-well plates and cultured for 2 days during which the majority 
 of mouse - derived cells ( red ) attached .
the resulting tumor aggregates 
 that formed ( blue ) then were encapsulated within ha - sh / peg - da hydrogels 
 and cultured for up to 14 days .
( b ) dissociated tumor cells plated on tissue culture plastic 
 for 2 days formed multicellular clusters in suspension with other 
 cell types adhering to the plastic surface .
( c ) mixture of dapi - stained 
 ( blue ) cells within tumoroids and adherent cells after 2 days in culture . 

scale bars = 100 
 m . in optimizing the culture conditions 
 for the pdx pca cells
, we 
 observed that most of the mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b pca cells that 
 had undergone mechanical and enzymatic digestion and been plated onto 
 6-well plates formed multicellular aggregates in suspension after 
 2 days in culture , presumably reflecting their characteristic poor 
 adherence onto tissue culture plastic ( figure 1b ) .
additionally , during this period , we noted that a population 
 of cells in the tumor slurry ( shown in red in figure 1a ) adhered to the tissue culture plastic surface .
leveraging 
 this phenomenon , we collected the aggregates in suspension ( leaving 
 behind the adherent cells ) and found that the process of gentle centrifugation 
 resulted in the removal of dead cells . given that the mda pca 183 
 and mda pca 118b tumors were grown as subcutaneous tumors in mice , 
 they carry along with them a subpopulation of mouse - derived cells 
 in addition to the human pca cells .
indeed , we found that among the 
 poorly adherent pca cells that formed multicellular aggregates in 
 suspension after 2 days on tissue culture plastic , the cells that 
 had adhered stained positive for vimentin ( figure 1c ) . henceforth , we employed this pre - encapsulation 2d culture 
 method , which not only removes dead cells , but also enriches the pdx 
 tumor population via the depletion of mesenchymal cells .
a summary 
 of the process used to form 3d pdx tumoroids within the ha - sh / peg - da 
 hydrogel is illustrated in figure 1a . in the first week 
 after encapsulation ,
mda pca 183 cells were maintained as large tumoroids 
 with most having diameters between 60100 m .
mda pca 
 118b cells were maintained as smaller tumoroids , typically smaller 
 than 60 m in diameter ( figure 2a and supplementary figure 1 ) .
cells in tumoroids were 
 in close contact in multicellular clusters , observed via staining 
 with phalloidin for f - actin ( figure 2b ) . to 
 demonstrate that human pca cells comprise the 3d pdx tumoroids , we 
 stained the encapsulated cells for epithelial cell adhesion molecule 
 ( epcam ) , an established marker for epithelial cells .
as expected , 
 both the mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b 3d pdx tumoroids stained positive 
 for epcam ( figure 2c ) , indicating that the 
 tumoroids form from self - sorting epithelial cells despite the presence 
 of mesenchymal cells in the original xenograft tumors .
additionally , 
 we also confirmed this by probing for the human - specific anti - nuclei 
 antibody and found that the majority of cells within the tumoroids 
 stained positive ( data not shown ) , indicating that the 3d pdx tumoroids 
 form from largely human cells .
next , we asked if the pca cells in 
 tumoroids retained their androgen receptor activation status . probing 
 specifically for the androgen receptor , we found that while the androgen 
 receptor was mainly localized in the nucleus of cells in the mda pca 
 183 tumoroids , nuclear localization of the receptor was not observed 
 in the mda pca 118b cells as would be expected in vivo .
generation 
 of pdx tumoroids encapsulated within 3d ha - sh / peg - da 
 hydrogels .
( a ) mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b cells remained as multicellular 
 tumoroids post - encapsulation , over 1 week in culture .
cells were stained with dapi ( blue ) or phalloidin ( green ) ; 
 a merged image is shown on the right panel .
( c ) hydrogel - encapsulated mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b cells were 
 stained with dapi ( blue ) , and with antibodies against epcam ( green ) 
 and the androgen receptor ( red ) . while the mda pca 183 cells exhibited 
 nuclear localization of the androgen receptor ( indicated by yellow 
 arrows ) , the mda pca 118b cells stained negative for nuclear localization 
 of the androgen receptor .
encapsulation 
 of the nonadherent tumoroids into ha - sh / peg - da hydrogels maintained 
 cell  cell contacts for at least 2 weeks in culture .
given that 
 these pdx pca tumors exhibit poor viability in vitro on 2d , we next 
 investigated whether the encapsulated pdx tumoroids remained viable 
 within the hydrogels over time using the live / dead viability / cytotoxicity 
 assay .
as shown in figure 3 , cells in both 
 the mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b tumoroids were predominantly viable 
 at days 1 , 5 , and 14 . remarkably , pdx cells had the highest survival 
 when they had formed large clusters with other cells .
dead or dying 
 cells in each hydrogel were observed to be one of two types : either 
 single cells that had not aggregated with other cells to form multicellular 
 clusters or cells on the periphery of each cluster ( particularly prominent 
 in figure 3b , day 14 ) . beyond viability , to 
 establish if the 3d pdx tumoroids demonstrate tumor growth characteristics 
 necessary for the model to serve as a drug - testing platform , particularly 
 for drug candidates that target actively dividing cells , we monitored 
 their growth over 1 week in culture , using dna content as a surrogate 
 measure of cellularity .
notably , the overall cellularity of the mda 
 pca 118b constructs was lower than that of the mda pca 183 because 
 the mda pca 118b cells formed smaller clusters , therefore the retrieval 
 of cells for hydrogel encapsulation was less efficient than from the 
 mda pca 183 cultures .
this is apparent from the finding that even 
 though a higher theoretical seeding density ( 150,000 and 300,000 cells 
 per construct for mda pca 183 and 118b , respectively ) was employed 
 for the mda pca 118b constructs , the average initial dna content of 
 the mda pca 118b constructs still was lower than that of the mda pca 
 183 constructs ( day 1 , figure 4a ) . in analyzing 
 the cellularity of
the 3d pdx constructs over time , while dna content 
 remained constant with no significant difference over time for the 
 mda pca 183 tumoroids , there was a significant decrease in cellularity 
 for the mda pca 118b from day 1 to 5 , after which an increase in cellularity 
 was observed ( figure 4a ) . probing the 3d pdx 
 tumoroids for ki-67 and cleaved caspase-3 , markers 
 of proliferation and apoptosis , respectively , we found that differences 
 in the proportion of proliferative and apoptotic cells at day 5 in 
 culture was not apparent for either mda pca 183 or 118b ( figure 4b , c ) .
panels in ( a ) and ( b ) show mda pca 183 and 118b after 1 , 5 , and 14 
 days in culture , respectively . cells were stained with calcein - am 
 ( green , left panel ) or ethidium homodimer-1 ( red , middle panel ) .

having demonstrated 
 that the encapsulated 3d pdx tumoroids are ( 1 ) made up of viable pca 
 cells , ( 2 ) maintain in vivo - like androgen receptor distribution , and 
 ( 3 ) are proliferative in the hydrogels , we next determined the suitability 
 of this in vitro platform for drug testing of primary pca cells . given 
 the inherent differences in origin between the mda pca 118b and mda 
 pca 183 pdx models , we hypothesized that they would demonstrate a 
 differential sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs . to test this hypothesis
, 
 we exposed the 3d mda pca 183 and mda pca 118b tumoroids to docetaxel , 
 currently part of the first line regimen to treat patients with castrate - resistant 
 metastatic pca .
surprisingly , we found that not only was there no 
 overall difference in docetaxel sensitivity between the 3d mda pca 
 183 and mda pca 118b tumoroids , no significant reduction in cell number 
 was detected within the range of docetaxel concentrations tested for 
 either 3d tumoroid systems ( figure 5a ) .
to 
 confirm these findings , we performed the live / dead viability / cytotoxicity 
 assay and found that cells were largely viable even at the highest 
 docetaxel concentration ( figure 5b ) .
additionally , 
 there were no apparent differences in the proportion of apoptotic 
 cells as indicated by cleaved caspase-3 staining at the various docetaxel 
 concentrations tested ( supplementary figure 2 ) . to demonstrate that the lack of cell - kill was cell source - dependent , 
 we similarly exposed hydrogel - encapsulated cells from a bone metastatic 
 prostate cancer cell line , c4 - 2b , to docetaxel .
interestingly , a significant 
 decrease in cellularity was already apparent between 1 and 10 nm ( figure 5a , b ) .
this finding was corroborated by an observed 
 increase in the proportion of ethidium homodimer-1-stained cells with 
 increasing concentration of docetaxel ( figure 5b ) .
notably , given that viable c4 - 2b cells were present at 10,000 
 nm as observed by calcein - am staining , it is likely that the decrease 
 in the proportion of calcein - am - stained c4 - 2b cells due to drug cytotoxicity 
 could not be clearly discerned when compared to controls .
we also 
 showed that the pdx cells were readily killed with 1 m sodium azide ; 
 thus , it was likely not an issue of drug accessing the pca cells ( data 
 not shown ) .

 of 3d mda pca 183 and 118b constructs after exposure to increasing 
 docetaxel concentrations , compared to the c4 - 2b cell line , also hydrogel - encapsulated . 

c4 - 2b cells exhibited significantly lower resistance to docetaxel 
 as compared to both pdxs ( p < 0.05 ) .

 of cells after exposure to 0 , 10 , or 10,000 nm docetaxel , assessed

in 
 this study , we assessed a 3d ha - based hydrogel system for the 
 culture of primary pdx bone metastatic pca tumors , well - known to exhibit 
 poor viability when cultured on tissue culture plastic in vitro . given 
 the ubiquity of ha in the bone marrow extracellular matrix and our 
 previous studies that demonstrated the feasibility of using 3d ha - based 
 hydrogels to culture poorly adherent bone metastatic pca cell lines , 
 we hypothesized that these biologically active hydrogels would serve 
 as excellent matrices to support the long - term culture of primary 
 pdx pca tumor tissue in vitro .
the inability of bone metastatic 
 pca cells , whether derived from 
 cell lines or primary pdx tumor tissue , to grow in 2d culture is an 
 established phenomenon that indicates the lack of critical components 
 from the bone microenvironment upon which these highly adapted cells 
 depend . in optimizing the culture conditions for the 3d pdx pca cells
, 
 we found that the cancer cells failed to adhere to tissue culture 
 plastic , as was expected .
instead , these cells aggregated to form 
 multicellular aggregates in suspension , where the formation of cell 
cell 
 contact is a likely mechanism employed by the pca cells to adapt to 
 the loss of native cell - matrix interactions . indeed , as proposed by 
 shen and kramer , cancer cells are capable of undergoing  synoikis  , 
 a term that was used to describe the avoidance of apoptosis by relying 
 on intercellular adhesions in the absence of cell  matrix interactions .
focusing specifically on squamous cell carcinoma 
 cells , the authors demonstrated that e - cadherin - mediated cell  cell 
 contact resulted in the generation of compensatory survival signaling 
 via the epidermal growth factor receptor .
interestingly , a similar observation was made by a landmark report 
 by kondo et al .
cell 
 interactions were necessary for the survival of primary patient - derived 
 colorectal cancer cells in suspension culture . in optimizing the culture method for the primary 
 pdx pca cells , 
 we leveraged the ability of the cancer cells to spontaneously aggregate 
 to form multicellular clusters in suspension as a means to reduce 
 the presence of  contaminant  cells such as dead cells , 
 including those that were originally from the tumor tissue itself 
 ( in regions of necrosis ) and those that were generated during the 
 process of tumor digestion .
we found that the application of gentle 
 centrifugation to retrieve the pca aggregates in suspension after 
 2 days on tissue culture plastic was an effective method to separate 
 the pca cells from dead cells in suspension prior to encapsulation 
 within the hydrogel .
given that the pdx pca cells were maintained 
 in mice prior to harvest , the cancer cells were also likely  contaminated  

with mouse - derived cells ( such as blood cells , endothelial cells , 
 or fibroblasts ) , which consequently introduces a source of heterogeneity 
 and complicates downstream biochemical studies .
furthermore , considering 
 the importance of the tumor microenvironment in influencing tumor 
 behavior , the presence of mouse - derived stroma may confound studies 
 evaluating species - specific stroma - targeting drug candidates , hence 
 making it a major hindrance in current pdx tumor models .
indeed , while the pca cells formed aggregates 
 in suspension , a population of cells was consistently observed to 
 adhere to the tissue culture plastic surface .
for example , in mda 
 pca 183 cultures , we found that the adherent cells expressed vimentin 
 and originated from mouse tissue ( figure 1c ) . 
 while further characterization is necessary to determine the actual 
 yield of the cancer cells
, these results , in conjunction with the 
 observation that epcam , an epithelial cell marker , was near - ubiquitously 
 expressed in all of the hydrogel - encapsulated pdx clusters ( figure 2c ) , highly suggest that the pre - encapsulation 2d 
 culture serves as a desirable selective method to generate viable 
 and enriched pdx pca cells in 3d . in this study , we optimized 
 the culture of pdx pca cells in vitro , 
 which to our knowledge is unprecedented . while robust growth was limited 
 by a balance between proliferation and apoptosis , viability of the 
 hydrogel - encapsulated pca cells
was notably well maintained even up 
 to 14 days in culture ( figure 3 ) .
ten to 20% 
 of cells within the 3d pdx tumoroids stained positive for ki-67 at day 5 in culture ( figure 4b , c ) , indicating that a subset of cells was still progressing through 
 the cell cycle .
comparing the proportion of proliferative cells within 
 the 3d mda pca 118b pdx tumoroids to their in vivo counterparts , we 
 found that our estimate of ki-67-positive cells is 
 well within the range of that in vivo .
we are currently modifying the ha - based hydrogel to study the effects 
 of ecm moieties and other cell types on the growth behavior of the 
 pdx pca tumoroids in 3d culture . with the shift in focus from 
 traditional chemotherapy to biologically 
 targeted approaches based on a mechanistic understanding of pca biology , 
 preservation of salient features of
the original tumor is a critical 
 criterion in evaluating the success of this culture system as a drug - testing 
 platform . to this end
the androgen receptor is an important modulator 
 for prostate growth and currently the primary therapeutic target in 
 pca .
additionally , this nuclear receptor 
 regulates psa expression , which is used clinically as a biochemical 
 marker to track the progression of pca and response to therapy .
predominantly cytoplasmic in the absence of 
 ligands , ligand binding to the androgen receptor results in conformational 
 changes , nuclear translocation of the ligand - bound receptor , and transcriptional 
 activity . mirroring the in vivo tumor , 
 detection of nuclear androgen receptor in the 3d mda pca 183 tumoroids 

indicates that the ha - sh / peg - da hydrogel system is capable of maintaining 
 critical androgen receptor signaling in these androgen - dependent cells . 

similarly , nuclear androgen receptor was not observed in the 3d mda 
 pca 118b tumoroids as would be expected in in vivo , indicating that 
 these 3d pdx models may have utility as drug - testing platforms evaluating 
 androgen receptor - targeting agents currently under intense clinical 
 investigation .
drug discovery and screening 
 has historically relied on cancer 
 cell lines , which have generated a wealth of knowledge in cancer biology . 

however , the dichotomy in drug efficacy between preclinical and clinical 
 testing is increasingly apparent , primarily attributed to the genetic 
 and epigenetic changes that accrue when cells acclimatize to the in 
 vitro culture environment in extended periods of cell culture . indeed , gillet et al .
evaluated the multidrug 
 resistance transcriptome of six cancer types and found no correlation 
 between clinical samples and established cell lines , underscoring 
 the need for new in vitro cancer models and primary tumor models .
hypothesizing that inherent differences exist 
 between traditional pca cell lines and pdx pca tumors , we evaluated 
 the response of the 3d pdx pca tumoroids ( mda pca 183 and 118b ) to 
 docetaxel and compared their response to the c4 - 2b bone metastatic 
 prostate cancer cell line
. docetaxel is a microtubule stabilizer and 
 is currently part of the first - line standard treatment for metastatic 
 castrate - resistant pca .
we found that 
 despite the differences between the mda pca 183 and 118b cells in 
 patient origin , their overall drug sensitivity to docetaxel was similar . 

given that both pdx - derived cultures showed a low number of proliferating 
 cells and that docetaxel targets actively dividing cells , it thus 
 was unsurprising that both demonstrated similar resistance to the 
 drug in 3d culture .
however , interestingly , the 3d pdx pca cells exhibited 
 a significantly higher resistance to the drug as compared to the c4 - 2b 
 cells .
it is unlikely that the increased resistance is due to impaired 
 diffusion of the drug into the hydrogel since it demonstrated clear 
 efficacy against the hydrogel - encapsulated c4 - 2b cells
. while results 
 from this drug study are promising , studies are ongoing to establish 
 clinical relevance and understand the mechanisms underlying this difference . with the increasing awareness
that irreversible biological changes 
 occur when conventional cell lines are established in vitro , beyond 
 prostate cancer , there is general shift toward the use of pdx tumor 
 models for cancer research .
however , their 
 utility depends on the ability to manipulate the tumor cells ex vivo 
 prior to implantation .
given the alterations 
 in biological properties associated with 2d culture , a few groups 
 have taken steps to optimize methods to reliably grow primary tumor 
 cells in 3d .
one such example is in colorectal cancer , where it has 
 been shown that primary colorectal cancer cells can be cultured as 
 3d spheroids or colospheres in vitro , enabling the manipulation of 
 the cancer cells before engraftment in vivo for controlled studies . in our current study , we demonstrate for the first time that primary 
 bone metastatic pca cells can similarly be cultured in vitro with 
 the use of a 3d ha - based hydrogel system .
lastly , this 3d pdx model 
 may ultimately be adapted to a rapid and high throughput platform 
 for assessing drug efficacy , rational drug combinations , and development 
 of predictive biomarkers for novel targeted therapies , while reducing 
 the need for low throughput animal hosts . as an example
, we showed 
 here that 3d pdx pca cells exhibited an increased resistance to docetaxel 
 as compared to a standard cell line commonly used in pca research . 

ultimately , it is envisioned that the use of 3d pdx models may greatly 
 accelerate the advancement of novel drug candidates together with 
 predictive biomarkers that enable patient selection when translated 
 into early phase clinical trials .
on the basis of previous success culturing bone metastatic pca 
 cell lines using 3d ha - based hydrogels , we demonstrate for the first 
 time that  never in 2d  pdx pca tumors can be cultured 
 in vitro and maintained for at least 2 weeks .
the resulting hydrogel - encapsulated 
 3d pdx tumoroids retained viability , proliferative capacity , and the 
 androgen receptor expression , indicating that this novel 3d pdx model 
 may serve as a valuable platform for drug development .
while it has 
 yet to be tested , this system promises the possibility of culturing 
 tumor tissue directly from the patient for rapid drug screening , thereby 
 eliminating the  middle mouse  and its associated problems , 
 a major leap toward personalized medicine ."	" the lack of effective 
 therapies for bone metastatic prostate cancer 
 ( pca ) underscores the need for accurate models of the disease to enable 
 the discovery of new therapeutic targets and to test drug sensitivities 
 of individual tumors . to this end , 
 the patient - derived xenograft ( pdx ) 
 pca model using immunocompromised mice was established to model the 
 disease with greater fidelity than is possible with currently employed 
 cell lines grown on tissue culture plastic . 
 however , poorly adherent 
 pdx tumor cells exhibit low viability in standard culture , making 
 it difficult to manipulate these cells for subsequent controlled mechanistic 
 studies . to overcome this challenge , we encapsulated pdx tumor cells 
 within a three - dimensional hyaluronan - based hydrogel and demonstrated 
 that the hydrogel maintains pdx cell viability with continued native 
 androgen receptor expression . 
 furthermore , a differential sensitivity 
 to docetaxel , a chemotherapeutic drug , was observed as compared to 
 a traditional pca cell line . 
 these findings underscore the potential 
 impact of this novel 3d pdx pca model as a diagnostic platform for 
 rapid drug evaluation and ultimately push personalized medicine toward 
 clinical reality . "	"Introduction

the range of behaviours or mechanisms organisms employ may be puzzling . at times , an apparent simplicity is observed .
either have chemical defences to ward off herbivores or have symbiotic relationships with protective ants ( rehr et  al . 1973 ) .
hosts parasitised by eurasian cuckoos cuculus canorus famously reject cuckoo eggs , but never reject cuckoo chicks ( davies 2000 ) .
this simplicity may be the result of evolutionary lag but , more interestingly , may also be caused by one strategy making another maladaptive by reducing predator abundance ( planqu et  al .
different mechanisms may complement one another , and true redundancy is often hard to show ( able and bingman 1987 ) .
indeed , the existence of a suite of mechanisms against a broad ensemble of predators is readily understandable .
another striking example of a system in which different mechanisms augment and complement one another , but now at a collective level , is house hunting in social insects .
this has become one of the model systems to study distributed decision making in animals . when the nest is destroyed , the colony has to decide collectively where to settle next during a time of crisis ( franks et  al .
individual ants or bees have been shown to combine sophisticated assessments of potential nest sites ( seeley 1977 ; seeley and morse 1978 ; mallon and franks 2000 ; franks et  al .
2003b ) with various recruitment mechanisms to collate information , and thus make collective decisions ( mallon et  al . 2001 ; pratt et  al . 2002 ; pratt 2005 ; seeley and visscher 2003 , 2004 ; visscher 2007 ) .
when the old nest is destroyed , a fraction of ants goes out scouting to find a new home . upon finding a nest ,
the nest is assessed ( mallon and franks 2000 ) and ants start recruiting other ants to it with a latency that is inversely proportional to the perceived nest quality ( mallon et  al .
2001 ) , using a process called forward tandem running ( mglich et  al .
1974 ) . during a forward tandem run , a knowledgeable ant teams up with a nave ant .
the leader slowly progresses towards the new nest , each time waiting for the follower to catch up , thereby teaching her the way ( franks and richardson 2006 ) . through this slow recruitment process ,
once a nest population reaches a certain quorum threshold , the recruiters switch from slow tandem running to much faster social carrying , and transport the remaining passive ants and brood to the new nests ( pratt et  al .
this description has been the basis of several models ( pratt et  al . 2002 ; pratt et  al .
. however , a behaviour commonly employed by these ants is usually not included ( but see pratt et  al .
recruiter ants are not only engaged in social carrying , but also regularly perform tandem runs from the new back to the old nest .
these so - called reverse tandem runs ( mglich 1978 ) are often more common than forward tandem runs ( mallon et  al .
2002 ) , but their function is much less well understood . to maximise fitness , the colony should emigrate as quickly as possible to avoid predation and other hazards . therefore , during house hunting , a fast build up of recruiters is essential .
why then do ants mix fast carrying with slow reverse tandem running , when they already have forward tandem running at their disposal ?
in particular , through the use of mathematical models , we explore under what circumstances reverse tandem running can have a positive influence on emigration speed .
we present two mathematical models to investigate the possible role of reverse tandem runs in ant colony emigrations .
reverse tandem running does not contribute to the decision - making process of which new nest to choose ( pratt et  al . 2002 ; franks et  al .
only a small fraction of the ants in a colony are actively involved during emigrations ( pratt et  al . 2002 ; langridge 2006 ) . in this paper , we thus divide the colony s n ants into fractions fn of active ants a , and ( 1    f)n passive ants p. this assumption to divide ants into active and passive is a crucial one , without which the models collapse .
the rates at which active ants leave the nest and become scouts , and scouts recruiters , are given by  and k , respectively .
forward tandem running occurs at a rate  until the quorum q is met , after which recruiters carry passive ants and brood at a rate . to incorporate reverse tandem runs , we need to model which ants follow these tandem runs .
available data from nest - choice experiments ( mallon et  al . 2001 ) suggest two possibilities : either the reverse tandem runs are followed by ants that have not found the new nest yet , or by ants that have been carried to the new nest .
these two options are not necessarily mutually exclusive : the carried ants could have been scouts .
model 1 assumes that reverse tandem runs are followed by uncommitted scouts in the arena , and model 2 assumes they are followed by passive ants that were carried to the new nest . 

1diagrams of the two different models for which reverse tandem runs are hypothesised to increase speed .
the parameters are explained in table 1 diagrams of the two different models for which reverse tandem runs are hypothesised to increase speed .
the parameters are explained in table 1 to capture in detail the influence of reverse tandem runs on emigration dynamics , we need to consider the following points : 
 both tandem running and social carrying involve a pair of ants from two different classes .
hence , recruitment can only occur if ants of both participating classes are available;once the quorum has been met , recruiters can not carry and perform reverse tandem runs simultaneously ( we also assume recruiters are not involved in other activities than these two ) .
both tandem running and social carrying involve a pair of ants from two different classes .
hence , recruitment can only occur if ants of both participating classes are available ; once the quorum has been met , recruiters can not carry and perform reverse tandem runs simultaneously ( we also assume recruiters are not involved in other activities than these two ) .
we assume that ants of both classes are well mixed in the part of the arena ( or nest ) where they meet . with populations of ants of size x and y meeting ,
the number of ants that on average meet is then proportional to xy/(x  +  y ) .
importantly , the smallest class limits the interaction rate , as is to be expected .
we thus also have to specify how much post - quorum time recruiters spend on carrying or reverse tandem running ( they are assumed not to spend any time on other behaviours ) . before the quorum
is met , the rate at which active ants at the old nest , a , become recruiters , r , through tandem running is given by ra/(a  +  r ) .
now let f be the fraction of post - quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs , and the remainder 1    f spent on social carrying . then the mean number of scouts becoming recruiters through reverse tandem runs is

the  in the initial conditions is necessary to avoid singularities in the denominators of the interaction functions l , r and c. we have used   =  0.01 throughout .
the main hypothesis we tested on both these models was : reverse tandem runs speed up the emigration if recruiter numbers failed to increase early in the emigration ; this occurs through a combination of the new nest being hard to find and forward tandem running being prohibited .
we tested this hypothesis by finding the fastest emigration strategy for given parameter settings and determining whether reverse tandem runs formed part of this optimal strategy .
we first fixed the scouting parameter ,  , the fraction of active ants at the old nest , f , and k , the rate at which scouts become recruiters .
then quorum size q and fraction of post - quorum reverse tandem running time f were varied to optimise emigration speed .
emigrations were termed completed when all passive ants and active ants at the old nest had disappeared . in particular , we set the threshold for emigration completeness at p  +  a  =  0.01 .
optimal strategies were found using the nelder  mead simplex method ( nelder and mead 1965 ) .
parameters  and f were varied on an equidistant 2020 grid spanning [ 0.01,0.2 ] [0.05,0.5 ] .
the ranges of these parameters are inspired by experimental estimates in ( pratt et  al .

for both models , the optimal emigration strategy included reverse tandem runs for a wide range of parameters , together with low quorum thresholds ( fig .  2 ) .
fixing k whilst varying  and f , the optimal strategy often contained more reverse than forward tandem runs for a large part of the parameter range ( fig .  2 ) .
the fraction of time spent on reverse tandem running f and the quorum threshold q were negatively correlated .
when either the fraction of active ants f decreased or the scouting parameter  increased , fraction f increased , and the quorum q decreased . choosing a higher recruitment latency by decreasing k gave more reverse tandem running and lower quorum thresholds ( fig .  2 ) . 

2optimal fractions of post - quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs ( top figures ) , and optimal quorum thresholds ( bottom figures ) for models 1 ( left two columns ) and 2 ( right two columns ) for varying fractions of active ants f and scouting probabilities  and for two values of recruitment latencies k. other parameter values used are given in table  1 .
reverse tandem runs are part of the optimal emigration strategy when scouting probability is high or when fraction of active ants is low .
lowering k enhances the use of reverse tandem running optimal fractions of post - quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs ( top figures ) , and optimal quorum thresholds ( bottom figures ) for models 1 ( left two columns ) and 2 ( right two columns ) for varying fractions of active ants f and scouting probabilities  and for two values of recruitment latencies k. other parameter values used are given in table  1 .
reverse tandem runs are part of the optimal emigration strategy when scouting probability is high or when fraction of active ants is low .
lowering k enhances the use of reverse tandem running note that , although models 1 and 2 broadly give similar predictions , they differ in the amount of post - quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs . in model 1 , this reaches a full 100% in model 1 , but never so in model 2 .
overall , the models predict that reverse tandem running should be used more than forward tandem running , and the quorum threshold lowered , if the recruitment latency increases by decreasing k ( scouting ants wait longer before starting their first recruitment act ) , in combination with either a decreasing fraction of active ants f , or an increasing scouting parameter . for all but very large f , the optimal quorum threshold corresponded to the time when all active ants have left the old nest to go scouting . in the absence of multiple new nests , the decision when to switch from forward tandem running to social carrying is thus best made at the old nest .
recruiters should thus apply the following rule : continue forward tandem running until there are no ants left to perform them with and then switch to social carrying ; if few forward tandem runs have been performed ( by the recruiters ) , combine carrying with reverse tandem runs ; otherwise , do not .
the numbers of forward tandem runs , reverse tandem runs , the numbers of carried ants in the new nest and total emigration time were computed for each of the optimal strategies of models 1 and 2 ( fig . 
first , for a large parameter range , there are more reverse tandem runs than forward tandem runs .
this is broadly consistent with the experimental data from nest choice experiments in mallon et  al .
numbers there range between 3 and 17 forward tandems , and between 9 and 25 reverse tandems , and reverse tandems were always performed more often than forward tandems .
second , as a validation of our optimisation method , note that the optimal emigration time varies smoothly under parameter changes , as is to be expected for this type of model .
third , for model 1 , despite a clear drop in the post - quorum time spent on reverse tandem runs with increasing f ( see fig .  2 , top left ) , the number of reverse tandem runs in fact varies smoothly .
fourth , the number of carried ants that remained in the nest at the end of the emigration is clearly different between models 1 and 2 . in model 1
, this number is just ( 1    f)n , the number of passive ants in the colony . in model 2
, however , over half of the colony may end up being recruiters by drawing recruits from the carried class using reverse tandem runs . 

3numbers of forward and reverse tandem runs , number of carried ants and emigration time , computed for each of the optimal strategies for models 1 ( top row ) and 2 ( bottom row ) , illustrated in fig .  2 .
here we have only illustrated k  =  0.001 numbers of forward and reverse tandem runs , number of carried ants and emigration time , computed for each of the optimal strategies for models 1 ( top row ) and 2 ( bottom row ) , illustrated in fig . 
to maximise their fitness , ants should try to achieve the fastest emigrations to minimise vulnerability ( franks et  al .
therefore , the active ants either have to become scouts , discover a new site and then become recruiters or wait at the old nest until a recruiter leads them to the new nest .
both of these processes may be hampered : when all the active ants go out scouting , recruiter numbers slowly increase if the new nest is hard to find or if those few can not find any active ant back at the old nest to tandem run with . in terms of the models , this could occur if scouts slowly become recruiters ( low value for k ) , in combination with either a small class of active ants at the old nest ( f is small ) or all active ants having gone scouting ( high value for scouting rate  ) . under
either or both of these circumstances , the model predicts that ants should not waste time trying to recruit by forward tandem runs but should do the next best thing and use a low quorum threshold to quickly switch to carrying .
the recruiters should then invest a fraction of their time to recruit scouts or carried ants using reverse tandem runs , thus boosting the recruiter population and speeding up the emigration .
conversely , the model also predicts that reverse tandem runs should not be used if either the new nest is easy to find ( recruiter numbers then build quickly anyway ) , or when there are many ants to follow a forward tandem run .
ants have been shown to leave their intact old nest if the new nest is sufficiently better , but have lower standards when their nest is destroyed ( dornhaus et  al .
reverse tandem runs were mainly observed when the old nest was destroyed , combined with few forward tandem runs .
the model offers a simple explanation for this : the greater panic might have caused fewer scouts to remain at the old nest , thereby obstructing early recruitment . whilst investigating speed  accuracy trade - offs , franks et  al .
, this difference in reverse tandem running activity between mild and harsher conditions was found to be non - significant ( franks et  al .
although evidence for which ants follow reverse tandem runs is scarce , both models give the same qualitative predictions .
note , however , that the dynamics of the different ant classes during a simulated emigration in model 2 poorly match observed experimental dynamics ( see , e.g. , planqu et  al .
the final number of ants active in an emigration is much greater than the original number of active ants .
these recruiter numbers far exceed observed numbers of active ants ( available in table 3 in pratt et  al .
indeed , simulated emigrations often end with half the colony being recruiters and less than half carried into the new nest ( fig .  3 , bottom row , third from left ) . 

4examples of temporal dynamics for models 1 and 2 . at   =  0.05 , f  =  0.1447 , we have taken parameters optimal for models 1 and 2 , respectively .
notice that , in model 1 , the number of recruiters rises to about 35 , but in model 2 , there are no less than 100 recruiters at the end of the emigration , indicating that recruitment from the carried class ( model 2 ) may give rise to very unrealistic emigration dynamics examples of temporal dynamics for models 1 and 2 . at   =  0.05 , f  =  0.1447 , we have taken parameters optimal for models 1 and 2 , respectively . notice that , in model 1 , the number of recruiters rises to about 35 , but in model 2 , there are no less than 100 recruiters at the end of the emigration , indicating that recruitment from the carried class ( model 2 ) may give rise to very unrealistic emigration dynamics figure  2 ( top left ) shows that recruiters in model 1 should use a sequential strategy if f is small ( and  is large ) : when the quorum is met , they first spend all of their time on reverse tandem runs until all scouts have become recruiters , and then switch to carrying . in contrast ,
the total number of recruiters is bounded by fn , the number of active ants in the colony .
as f decreases , the remaining recruiters take longer to carry all the passive ants . hence
, the time costs for not having the recruiters increases and the time to recruit the remaining scouts decreases ( as there are fewer scouts too ) .
hence , in this situation , recruiters should devote their post - quorum time , first , all on reverse tandem running before starting carrying .
one does not have to make many hands if the work was light to start with .
note that this behaviour for f 0 is different for model 2 . in this paper
top right ) , as there is no end to building recruiter numbers but by completing the entire emigration .
this argument also explains another difference between these models : the number of reverse tandem runs during an emigration . in model 1 , there is a clear maximum for intermediate f , whereas in model 2 the number of reverse tandems strictly decreases with f ( fig .  3 , second from left , top and bottom ) .
contrary to the models in this paper , two previous models of house hunting by t.  albipennis ants ( pratt et  al .
the predictions of the current models proved to be strongly dependent on the assumption of non - linearity of these terms .
the corresponding linear models predicted that reverse tandem running should not be used for practically any parameter choices in f and  or k. another ingredient in this model shared with the previous ( pratt et  al .
2006 ) , models of this collective decision - making system is the division between active and passive ants .
all we know at present is that a limited fraction of ants is actively engaged during an emigration .
we have thus also explored models in which this division was absent , using both linear and non - linear interaction terms such as those in models 1 and 2 presented in this paper . in none of these models
the division between active and passive ants is thus a crucial ingredient for reverse tandem running to have a positive impact on emigration speed , which should be experimentally validated .
several hypotheses on the potential role of reverse tandem running have been put forward ( pratt et  al . 2002 ) .
first , the ants might have a  home nest  , which changes during the emigration , thereby reversing the direction of any recruitment events from  home  to another nest ( pratt et  al .
if true , this would predict a change of direction when about half of the colony had been displaced .
moreover , this hypothesis does not offer a suggestion why tandem running often occurs early in the emigration .
in other words , it might explain the direction , but not the occurrence itself .
second , it has been suggested that reverse tandem running may re - allocate recruitment ( pratt et  al .
reverse tandem runs were nearly always observed between the best nest and the old nest .
the models in this paper do not incorporate choice between nest sites , but we conjecture that early flexible commitment ( planqu et  al . 2006 ) will be more efficient in redirecting ants to better nests than late recruitment .
other experimental results also corroborate that reverse tandem running does not influence the decision - making process ( franks et  al .
the first models in which reverse tandem runs have been explicitly incorporated to analyse their role have yielded clear predictions : under a range of conditions , we expect a negative correlation between levels of early and late recruitment .
this finding lends itself well to simple experiments , and we aim to present those in the near future .
the build up of recruiter numbers serves two purposes : to decide on a nest and to increase the number of ants actively involved in transport .
this in itself is a side - effect of the distributed nature of this system .
this suggests that such additional backup behaviours could be a common feature of decentralised collective decision - making systems .

this suggests that such additional backup behaviours could be a common feature of decentralised collective decision - making systems ."	" to perform tasks , organisms often use multiple procedures . explaining the breadth of such behavioural repertoires is not always straightforward . during house hunting , 
 colonies of temnothorax albipennis ants use a range of behaviours to organise their emigrations . in particular , the ants use tandem running to recruit nave ants to potential nest sites . 
 initially , they use forward tandem runs ( ftrs ) in which one leader takes a single follower along the route from the old nest to the new one . 
 later , they use reverse tandem runs ( rtrs ) in the opposite direction . 
 tandem runs are used to teach active ants the route between the nests , so that they can be involved quickly in nest evaluation and subsequent recruitment . 
 when a quorum of decision - makers at the new nest is reached , they switch to carrying nestmates . 
 this is three times faster than tandem running . as a rule , having more ftrs 
 early should thus mean faster emigrations , thereby reducing the colony s vulnerability . 
 so why do ants use rtrs , which are both slow and late ? 
 it would seem quicker and simpler for the ants to use more ftrs ( and higher quorums ) to have enough knowledgeable ants to do all the carrying . in this study , we present the first testable theoretical explanation for the role of rtrs . 
 we set out to find the theoretically fastest emigration strategy for a set of emigration conditions . 
 we conclude that rtrs can have a positive effect on emigration speed if ftrs are limited . in these cases , 
 low quorums together with lots of reverse tandem running give the fastest emigration . "	"Introduction

11	"takayasu 's arteritis ( ta ) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that results in stenosis of medium to large sized arteries .
aorta and its major branches are mainly involved with subclavian artery being most commonly affected . on the other hand ,
characteristics of pulmonary arterial involvement are not well established , although its incidence was reported to reach approximately 56% of ta patients.1 ) we report here one case of right main pulmonary artery total 
 occlusion in a woman with ta , who had been diagnosed and treated with severe tricuspid regurgitation associated with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension for several years elsewhere .
a 52-year - old woman was referred to the outpatient clinic of rheumatology department with a 6-month history of dyspnea on exertion [ new york heart association ( nyha ) functional class ii to iii ] .
about 20 years ago , she visited a local clinic for non - healing toe wound and had a tentative diagnosis of ta .
ten years later , she visited another local clinic with a complaint of dyspnea on exertion ( nyha functional class ii ) . at that time , echocardiographic examination showed severe pulmonary hypertension with severe tricuspid regurgitation , based on which the attending physician prescribed diuretics and digoxin with a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension . despite the medications , however , she could not feel any improvement with regard to exertional dyspnea and she was advised to undergo surgery for severe tricuspid regurgitation . during preoperative work - ups , complete occlusion of right main pulmonary artery was incidentally detected .
her blood pressure was 78/39 mmhg at right arm and 99/70 mmhg at left arm .
her chest radiography showed a prominent left hilar opacity and right atrial enlargement ( fig .
laboratory parameters included increases in erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( 77 mm / hr ) and c - reactive protein ( 2.14 mg / dl ) .
on echocardiography , right ventricle ( rv ) was severely dilated , its wall thickness was increased , and rv systolic function was decreased .
severe tricuspid regurgitation and severe pulmonary hypertension with maximal pressure gradient of 131 mmhg were noted , as well . on basal parasternal short axis view
, the blood ejected from the rv to the main pulmonary artery appeared not to cross the right pulmonary artery .
when we carefully traced the proximal right pulmonary artery , we could not clearly delineate its opening ( fig .
lung perfusion scan showed the total absence of perfusion in the right lung with partial perfusion defects in the left lung ( fig .
3 ) , but no pulmonary thromboembolism was clearly demonstrated on computed tomographic pulmonary angiography .
the occlusion of right main pulmonary artery and left main pulmonary artery stenosis at the entrance were also clearly demonstrated on computed tomographic angiography ( fig .
4 ) . according to the result of cardiac catheterization performed elsewhere , the mean right atrial pressure was severely elevated ( 18.4 mmhg ) , and catheter was impossible to go into the right pulmonary artery .
coronary angiography demonstrated a huge left circumflex coronary artery to right pulmonary artery fistula ( fig .
arch aortography revealed total occlusion of the left subclavian and left common carotid artery in their proximities .
the diagnosis of ta was established based on the criteria of american college of rheumatology for classification of ta ; age at diagnosis ( less than 40 years ) , difference in systolic blood pressure between arms ( exceed 10 mmhg ) , arteriogram abnormality .
the patient was treated with corticosteroid , methotrexate , bosentan and symptomatic medications for right - sided heart failure .
she is now being followed in the rheumatology clinic on a regular basis and her symptoms showed slight improvement with these medications .
ta is a chronic inflammatory disease of aorta and its branches , and is acknowledged to be a disease of young asian women.2 ) the etiology is unclear , but the hypothesis is generally accepted that cell - mediated autoimmunity triggered by unidentified factors such as infection and/or genetic factors plays a major role in the pathogenesis of ta.3 ) in this respect , suppression of inflammatory reaction before irreversible damage takes place is believed to be of clinical importance . in 1908 , mikito takayasu , japanese ophthalmologist , first described a case about retinal arteriovenous fistula . at the same conference , 2 other cases with similar funduscopic findings were also reported , in whom pulse could not be palpable in one or both radial arteries .
several cases have been reported thereafter , and the term ' takayasu 's arteritis ' was coined in 1939.2 ) a year later , pulmonary artery involvement of ta was first described in ta patients and it was reported that pathologic changes of affected pulmonary arteries were very similar to those observed in systemic vessels.4 ) subsequently , prevalence of pulmonary artery involvement was estimated approximately 10% to 50% in ta patients , with a variety of pathological manifestations like stenosis , occlusion , or only vessel wall irregularity.5 ) although abnormal pulmonary arteriograms or isolated pulmonary artery involvement was previously reported,5)6 ) there was no case reporting complete occlusion of one pulmonary artery , resulting in severe pulmonary hypertension .
the mainstay of ta treatment is glucocorticoid , but its relapse is common with glucocorticoid tapering .
cytotoxic agents did not show successful results in glucocorticoid - dependent or resistant patients , either . as an alternative treatment option , surgical correction of stenosed
( not total occluded ) vessels followed by glucocorticoid therapy was previously reported to improve outcome and decreased morbidity.7 ) recently , biologic agents such as anti - tumor necrosis factor , interleukin-6 inhibitor are being under active investigation.8 ) in this case , ta has not been previously treated at all because the patient 's pulmonary hypertension was considered to be idiopathic in origin .
after confirmation of ta diagnosis , corticosteroid treatment was immediately started , but she felt no symptomatic relief .
considering her long past medical history , her left pulmonary vasculature might be already damaged , more or less , on top of total occluded right pulmonary artery , which is the main reason why we prescribed bosentan to this patient . of note
, we found the presence of a fistula from the left circumflex coronary artery to the right pulmonary artery .
although we can not provide definite explanation of the origin of the coronary - to - pulmonary fistula , this may be congenital in origin or may originate from de novo development along the natural course of ta .
no matter what , this finding has never been reported before , as far as we know . with rigorous efforts to finding possible causes of her pulmonary hypertension at the initial stage , the outcome could have been changed .
echocardiography is a useful noninvasive tool for predicting pulmonary artery systolic pressure using tricuspid regurgitation jet flow on the basis of modified bernoulli equation [ i.e. , systolic pulmonary artery pressure = ( maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity ) + right atrial pressure ] .
however , one important point that we should keep in mind is that , this simple equation is ultimately realized on the assumption that pulmonary arterial or valvular stenosis is not present .
this assumption is very simple but is frequently missed when we perform echocardiographic examination in our daily clinical practice.9 ) in this case , more careful inspection of both proximal pulmonary arteries could have detected the occlusion of right pulmonary artery and could have been helpful for the appropriate treatment .
thus , comprehensive echocardiographic examination is of crucial value for assessing ta patients , especially in those with suspicious pulmonary hypertension ."	" takayasu 's arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that mainly involves medium to large sized arteries . 
 although pulmonary artery involvement is reported with a prevalence of about 10% to 50% , its clinical significance is underestimated . 
 we report here one case of takayasu 's arteritis complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension due to right main pulmonary artery total occlusion . "	"Introduction

Discussion"
14	"in our recent article  sequestosome 1/p62 facilitates her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis through multiple signaling pathways  , we reported that the adaptor protein sequestosome 1 ( sqstm1 ) , also known as p62 , is required for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2)-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis in allograft and transgenic mouse mammary tumor models .
our findings are similar to the results of an earlier publication on ras - induced lung cancer .
these 2 studies , taken together , implicate p62 in potent oncogene - driven epithelial tumorigenesis and suggest that p62 may be a therapeutic target in such malignancies .
p62 is a multidomain protein that governs a diverse array of signaling pathways , and its deregulation has been implicated in paget 's disease of bone ( pdb ) , neurodegenerative diseases , liver disorders , and cancer .
transcriptional activation of nf - e2-related factor-2 ( nrf2 ) and defective autophagy can both lead to p62 accumulation , whereas p62 in turn regulates nrf2 stability through its interaction with kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1 ) . upon binding to polyubiquitinated substrates
, p62 serves as a cargo carrier to proteasomes and the autophagic machinery , where it is degraded along with the cargo .
furthermore , p62 is involved in nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) activation , receptor trafficking , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 ( erk1 ) inhibition , and mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) signaling . as a result ,
disruption of p62 homeostasis impairs disposal of toxic cellular waste , response to oxidative stress , and normal cell signaling .
our interest in the role of p62 in her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis was initially triggered by previously published studies that reported increased p62 levels in her2-positive breast tumors .
we found that her2 overexpression results in p62 accumulation at the protein level , possibly due to her2-induced autophagy suppression as described in another recent study from our laboratory .
two- and 3-dimensional culture of her2-expressing sqstm1 immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cells ( immecs ) revealed that p62 is required for cell survival upon amino acid starvation and during lumen formation in acinar morphogenesis .
as the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 ( pten)/phosphoinositide-3-kinase ( pi3k)/akt axis is known to promote cell survival and her2-mediated mammary oncogenesis , we examined the role of p62 in this signaling pathway .
our results demonstrated that her2-induced activation of akt , glycogen synthase kinase 3  ( gsk3 ) and -catenin in mammary cells is dependent on the presence of p62 both in vitro and in vivo .
furthermore , our studies revealed a newly discovered role for p62 in pten regulation . in the presence of p62
, her2 overexpression activates the pi3k axis while reducing pten protein levels in vitro and in vivo .
in contrast , in the absence of p62 , her2-dependent activation of the pi3k pathway is suppressed in association with increased pten expression , suggesting that p62 is required for pten downregulation and resultant induction of pi3k signaling in her2-expressing mouse mammary tumor cells .
whether p62 also activates the akt / gsk3/-catenin axis independently of pten remains to be investigated .
given the established role of p62 in activation of nf-b and the nrf2-driven antioxidant response , we also examined the impact of p62 loss on these pathways and found that in vivo activation of nf-b and nrf2 signaling in response to her2 overexpression also depends on p62 .
a limitation of our study is that we did not investigate every pathway that p62 is known to be involved in , such as the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) pathway .
a role for p62 in her2-mediated regulation of the mapk pathway would not be surprising , as p62 has been reported to inhibit erk1 phosphorylation . nevertheless , and in accordance with the complex nature of cancer
, our study shows that p62 contributes to her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis in an elaborate manner that can not be attributed to a single mechanism ( fig .
figure 1.p62 is a hub of multiple signaling pathways in her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis . in response to her2 overexpression in mammary epithelial cells
, p62 is upregulated at the protein level , which in turn negatively regulates pten and activates pi3k signaling , thus leading to tumorigenic signaling cascades .
it is also possible that p62 exerts its effects on the akt / gsk3/-catenin axis independently of pten downregulation .
her2-induced p62 accumulation alters mammary ductal morphogenesis by enhancing side - branching while suppressing lumen formation , and promotes anchorage independence and cellular transformation in vitro , as well as mammary tumorigenesis in vivo .

our finding that p62 mediates activation of the pi3k / akt / gsk3/-catenin and nf-b pathways in parallel with a reduction in pten levels in response to her2 overexpression led us to hypothesize that , in addition to potential direct interactions , p62 may also regulate these signaling axes indirectly through its effect on pten protein stability . since p62 participates in proteasome- and autophagy - mediated protein degradation , it is possible that her2-induced p62 accumulation promotes pten degradation by either or both mechanisms .
thorough exploration of the mechanism(s ) involved in p62-mediated pten downregulation in response to her2 activation will certainly be of great interest .
another finding of our study , which is intriguing and worthy of future investigation , is the observation that while p62 loss sensitizes her2-expressing mammary tumor cells to amino acid withdrawal , it also renders these cells more resistant to glucose deprivation .
given that autophagy is activated as a prosurvival function in response to amino acid starvation , we entertained the idea that sqstm1 her2-expressing immecs cells might be autophagy - defective compared to their wild - type counterparts .
however , and in agreement with an earlier report , our results showed that neither autophagic flux nor degradation of long - lived proteins is affected by p62 loss .
it thus appears that her2-expressing mammary tumor cells survive in the absence of amino acids via a p62-mediated , but autophagy - independent , mechanism .
a possible explanation resides in the hypothesis that p62 may be essential for glycolysis upregulation , which is known to occur in breast cancer cells in response to her2 activation ; as a consequence , amino acid starvation may compromise her2-expressing mammary tumor cell survival only when p62 is lost and glycolysis can not be induced to sustain metabolic demands .
if this is the case , her2-expressing mammary tumor cells with intact p62 and metabolism dependent on increased glycolytic rates are expected to be more sensitive to glucose deprivation than their sqstm1-null counterparts , which are probably metabolically adjusted to accommodate defective glycolysis induction under nutritional stress .
since our results are in complete agreement with this prediction , we propose that p62 plays an essential role in the metabolic reprogramming of mammary tumor cells with active her2 signaling . in summary ,
our work identifies p62 as a hub of signaling and metabolic pathways in her2-induced mammary tumorigenesis and sets the stage for future studies focusing on the pathophysiology and the discovery of novel therapeutic targets in her2-positive breast cancer ."	" we recently reported that depletion of p62 in the background of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( her2 ) overexpression sensitizes mammary tumor cells to amino acid deprivation , abolishes cellular transformation in vitro , and suppresses mammary tumorigenesis in vivo . 
 extensive investigation on the underlying molecular mechanisms has revealed a multifaceted role for p62 in her2-associated mammary tumorigenesis . "	"Commentary

in this study , we evaluated whether risk of arrhytmia increases in fms , and in fms patients increased pd values were detected in fms patients when compared with the control group which demonstrates increased risk of arrhytmia in fms patients relative to the control group . if we consider that fms patients consist of relatively young patients , and increased risk of af with advanced age , it is important to follow up these patients in their old age .
neurohormonal factors , and autonomic dysfunction have been blamed in the etiopathogenesis of fms . in patients with fms
, it has been contemplated that together with autonomic activity , sustained , and variable heart rates also fluctuate . with time fluctations in heart rates decrease , and autonomic system is dominated by the sympathetic system .
healthy adults respond in the same way , however this condition is not always as pronounced as in fms patients .
it has been widely recognized that in fms , sympathetic system is tonically active during the resting phase , but hyporeactive against physical stimuli . if any other arrhytmogenic factor can not be identified , then autonomic dysfunction has been accepted as the cause of arrhytmias .
ablin et al . demonstrated the relationship between fms , and coronary artery disease , and cardiac dysfunction in 43 patients with fms .
some authors reported increased mortality risk in fms , but they could nt reveal its etiopathogenesis . in a study performed by doru et al .
the investigators detected increased prevalence of supraventricular tachycardia ( svt ) in 50 patients with fms relative to normal healthy individuals . in this study
they asserted that this phenomenon might be associated with increased sympathetic activity during night hours .
increased risk of arrhytmia may be one of the probable etiological factors for this increased risk of arrhytmia .
p - wave dispersion is considered as a specific , and sensitive marker of af . besides
dilaveris et al . detected significantly higher levels of pd when compared with the healthy group .
still in the same study , the authors determined a pd value of 40 msec is quiet sensitive ( 83% ) , and specific ( 85% ) in the determination of af risk with a 89% positive predictive value . in another study ,
higher pmax , and pd values were detected in patients with paf relative to the healthy control group .
still , in our study , pd value of the fms group was determined as 45 msec which demonstrates that fms patients are under the risk of af , and paf . in many studies
performed , it has been found that anxiety detected in healthy individuals increased cardiac autonomic imbalance , and the risk of coronary artery disease .
it has been demonstrated that increased qtd value is associated with increased sympathetic or decreased parasympathetic modulation .
severe degrees of anxiety were detected in the fsm group relative to the control group without any evidence of increased risk of vf or vt which might be related to the scarcity of our patient population .
both sympathetic , and parasympathetic stimuli can lead to the development of af via different mechanisms .
if we consider the role of autonomic dysfunction in the etiopathogenesis of fms , observance of arrhytmias in fms should not be a surprisng finding .
our study conveys importance , in that it revealed risk of af in patients with fms which was evidenced by the presence of pd in these patients .
scarcity of our patient population , and evaluation of arrhytmias using only ecg are major limitations of our study .
studies to be conducted with a larger patient , and control groups will provide more precise data . besides , with holter recording of alterations in patients heart rhythms will enable us to obtain long - lasting information which will facilitate detection of arrhytmias .
in conclusion , our study determined the presence of increased risk of atrial arrhytmia in fms disease .
atrial arrhytmias effect quality of life of the patients adversely , worsen preexisting disease , and also induce functional losses secondary to some ensuing complications .
fms patients should be followed up in consideration of this issue , and especially their risk for atrial fibrillation should be kept in mind ."	" objective : the aim of this study is to examine depression and anxiety related arrhytmia risk in fibromyalgia syndrome ( fms).methods : fifty - nine patients with the diagnosis of fms and 20 control participants were included in the study . 
 fibromyalgia impact questionnaire ( fiq ) , visual pain scale ( vps ) surveys were applied to determine the severity of the disease . 
 beck anxiety ( bas ) and beck depression scales ( bds ) were applied to all participants . 
 electrocardiograms were obtained from all participants . 
 p - wave dispersions ( pd ) were estimated to determine the risk of the atrial arrhythmia , and qt wave dispersion ( qtd ) and corrected qt(qtdd ) values were used to predict the risk of ventricular arrhythmia.results:bas and bds results were significantly higher in the patient group compared to the control group ( p0001 ) . in the patient group , pd was significantly longer ( p=0.034 ) . 
 other clinical , and demographic data did not differ significantly between groups.conclusion:in this study , the risk of arrhythmia in fms was evaluated and increased pd in patients with fms compared to the control group was detected . 
 this finding shows increased risk of atrial fibrilation ( af ) in patients with fms . if we consider that patients with fibromyalgia consist relatively of young patients together with the increased risk of af with age , it is important to follow - up these patients in later ages for af risk

DISCUSSION"
16	"in the previous issue of critical care , reintam and colleagues   report a novel scale for measuring gastrointestinal dysfunction , using as descriptors , feeding intolerance and intra - abdominal hypertension .
they demonstrate convincingly that their gastrointestinal failure score correlates in a graded manner with mortality , and adds prognostic power to the sepsis - related organ failure assessment ( sofa ) score .
but while the use of intra - abdominal hypertension as a measure of gastrointestinal dysfunction is novel , and reflects morbidity that was underappreciated 10 years ago , their scale falls short in providing a comprehensive measure of gastrointestinal dysfunction in critical illness .
the concept that the morbidity of critical illness arises through the development of potentially reversible physiologic failure of multiple organ systems was first articulated by arthur baue more than 30 years ago .
it was further refined by the accp / sccm consensus conference of 1991 , which suggested that the process involved graded degrees of organ system dysfunction , and proposed the terminology ' multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ' ( mods ) to describe it .
first , it recognizes that it is not a single event that jeopardizes the recovery of the critically ill patient , but rather an evolving state of physiologic insufficiency , often affecting organs remote to the site of the initial insult and necessitating the use of exogenous support to ensure survival .
second , it reflects the clinical reality that the process is variable in its expression , with differing systems being involved in different patients . finally , and of most pragmatic importance , the process is potentially reversible , and survival is possible , though strongly and inversely correlated with the aggregate severity of the process .
some 15 to 20 years ago , there emerged a spate of efforts to provide robust and reproducible criteria for the objective measurement of organ dysfunction [ 4 - 7 ] .
these are strikingly similar in their architecture , a reflection not only of an emerging consensus on what organ dysfunction is , but also of the substantial intellectual collaboration of those who developed the scores .
although the final products vary in specific details , they reflect an implicit consensus that a valid descriptor of organ dysfunction should meet certain criteria ( table 1 ) .
characteristics of an optimal descriptor of organ dysfunction the rationale for quantifying organ dysfunction is not to provide another tool to predict the outcome of critically ill patients ; dedicated prognostic scores such as the simplified acute physiology score ( saps ) and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ( apache ) do this more than adequately .
rather , their purpose is to measure the evolution over time of a multi - dimensional process , to enable response to specific unmet needs .
first , an organ dysfunction scale can serve as a measure of intensive care unit - related morbidity , and so reflect important , but non - mortal , outcomes in a complex patient population .
second , it can provide an aggregate measure of whether an individual patient is improving or deteriorating over time  a common challenge in an illness characterized by improvement in some dimensions , and deterioration in others .
third , it can measure new morbidity arising in a patient whose risk of dying at the time of intensive care unit admission is quantifiable , but unalterable , and for whom the real goal of care is to prevent de novo morbidity . finally , it can serve as a more sensitive and informative outcome measure for a population of patients for whom mortality risk is heavily influenced by pre - morbid conditions , and survival per se is of variable importance .
gastrointestinal failure was a classic feature in early descriptions of mods , and invariably measured as bleeding from acute stress ulceration of the stomach .
but stress ulceration has become distinctly uncommon , and so other metrics have been sought , including tolerance of enteral feeds , ileus and nasogastric drainage , intestinal ischemia , acalculous cholecystitis , and diarrhea . none of these have satisfactorily met criteria for face validity and utility as summarized in table 1 , and for this reason , gut dysfunction was omitted from the available organ dysfunction scales .
first , tolerance of enteral feeding is subjective , and reflects a clinical decision  to withhold feeds 
one would want to know how reproducible these criteria were when measured by different observers , and whether they showed a graded correlation with mortality risk ; the simple measure of nasogastric output does not .
second , intra - abdominal hypertension is not strictly a measure of gastrointestinal dysfunction , but rather of the combination of increased intra - abdominal pressure and decreased compliance of the abdominal wall , and its risk factors are conditions characterized by a need to administer large amounts of fluid in the setting of significantly increased capillary permeability .
these shortcomings notwithstanding , however , the authors are to be complimented on their continuing efforts to improve our ability to describe a common , frustratingly elusive , but intuitively important element of the mods . in an earlier publication , they found that the development of gastrointestinal failure reflected in a diverse group of gastrointestinal signs and symptoms was associated with an eightfold increase in mortality ; clearly , this is a problem that we need to understand better ."	" gastrointestinal dysfunction is an intuitively important , yet descriptively elusive component of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome . 
 reintam and colleagues have attempted to quantify this dimension using a combination of intolerance of enteral feeding , and the development of intra - abdominal hypertension . while they show that both parameters are associated with an increased risk of death ( and therefore that , in combination , the risk of death is even greater ) , they fall short in developing a novel descriptor of gastrointestinal dysfunction . 
 nonetheless , and even with its shortcomings , their effort is a welcome contribution to the surprisingly complex process of describing the morbidity of critical illness . "	"None

he had been treated with celebrex ( 200 mg / day ) and ultracet ( 325 mg acetaminophen plus 37.5 mg tramadol ) , a durogesic patch ( 25 g / hr ) , and repeated epidural steroid injections ( seven injections of caudal and/or transforaminal epidural blockers ) . despite these injections and a further increase in analgesic dosage
, he complained of persistent symptoms , with only 10 - 20% improvement over 1 - 2 weeks , and there were no improvements in functional status and walking distance . after obtaining irb approval and
written informed consent from the patient , we performed a transforaminal balloon decompression procedure to alleviate his radicular pain and to extend the duration of pain relief .
the patient was placed in the prone position , and a pillow was placed under his abdomen to minimize lumbar lordosis . after sterile preparation of the surgical field , an 18 g r - k needle ( epimed international , gloversville , usa ) was introduced into the l5 intervertebral foramen , and its tip was confirmed as being in the anterior epidural space by injection of contrast medium ( fig .
1 ) . fluoroscopy was used to visualize the target during the procedure . a 3 fr fogarty catheter (
edward lifescience , irvine , ca , usa ) filled with contrast medium was introduced into the epidural space of the l5 inter - vertebral foramen , and placed in the medial portion of the stenotic area .
the needle was slightly withdrawn , and repeated balloon decompression and deballooning were performed throughout the affected region , from the lateral recess to the dural sleeve , with each ballooning session lasting less than 5 seconds .
l4 intervertebral transforaminal decompression was also performed in the same manner . after removing the fogarty catheter ,
the r - k needle was reinserted and then 3 ml of a mixture of 0.8% lidocaine , 20 mg triamcinolone , and 1,500 iu of hyaluronidase was administered .
after the procedure , however , the patient complained of pain for three days . for the next 15 weeks , the patient reported markedly reduced leg pain ( 2 - 3/10 ) , improved functional status ( 20 - 26% ) and increased claudication distance ( 40 minutes ) .

a 65-year - old male , a farmer , presented with pains in his lower back and right leg in the distribution of l5 dermatome .
his symptoms had started 6 months earlier , but had become aggravated over the previous month .
physical examination showed no weakness in his lower extremities , normal reactions to light touch and pin prick , and normal arterial pulsations .
a lumbar mri scan for back pain one month earlier showed bilateral foraminal stenosis , l4 - 5 and l5-s1 , due to disc protrusion and bulging discs of the entire lumbar spine .
he had been treated with meloxicam 7.5 mg / day and repeated epidural steroid injections ( 4 injections of interlaminar and/or transforaminal epidural blockers ) , but the effects of this treatment persisted for only one month .
a 3 fr fogarty catheter was introduced into the epidural space of his right l5 intervertebral foramen , followed by serial balloon decompression .
after removal of the fogarty catheter , he was administered 3 ml of a mixture of 0.8% lidocaine , 20 mg triamcinolone , and 1,500 iu of hyaluronidase .
over the next 24 weeks , the patient reported no leg pain ( 0/10 ) , markedly improved functional status ( 4 - 8% ) and increased claudication distance ( no limitation to walking ) .
a 77-year - old male , a retired soldier , presented with pain in his lower back , radiating down his right leg in the distribution of l4 dermatome and his left leg in l4 , 5 dermatome .

motor strength testing showed 4/5 in both quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles , suggesting pain - induced reduction of strength .
he had a tingling sensation and numbness in his lateral calf and experienced leg pain after walking more than 10 m , making him unable to go to the bathroom in his house .
a lumbar mri scan for back pain two years earlier showed degenerative spondylolisthesis of l4 on l5 , causing severe central stenosis , with the cross - sectional area of his dural sac at the narrowest point being 40.4 mm .
lumbar mri also showed stenosis of both lateral recesses and both neural foramens , as well as retrolisthesis of l5 on s1 with disc bulging and facet arthrosis causing left neural foraminal stenosis .
he had been treated with opalmon 15 mg / day , lyrica 150 mg / day , ultracet and a fentanyl patch ( 25 g / hour ) , and had received 17 epidural steroid injections of transforaminal epidural blockers and decompressive neuroplasty . despite these injections and a further increase in analgesic dosage , he reported no improvements in pain and functional status .
he was not indicated for surgery because of his poor general condition , but was regarded as a candidate for spinal cord stimulation .
a 3 fr fogarty catheter was introduced into epidural space of the left l4 , l5 and the right l4 intervertebral foramen , and balloon decompression and drug administration were performed serially .

the patient was placed in the prone position , and a pillow was placed under his abdomen to minimize lumbar lordosis . after sterile preparation of the surgical field , an 18 g r - k needle ( epimed international , gloversville , usa ) was introduced into the l5 intervertebral foramen , and its tip was confirmed as being in the anterior epidural space by injection of contrast medium ( fig .
1 ) . fluoroscopy was used to visualize the target during the procedure . a 3 fr fogarty catheter (
edward lifescience , irvine , ca , usa ) filled with contrast medium was introduced into the epidural space of the l5 inter - vertebral foramen , and placed in the medial portion of the stenotic area .
the needle was slightly withdrawn , and repeated balloon decompression and deballooning were performed throughout the affected region , from the lateral recess to the dural sleeve , with each ballooning session lasting less than 5 seconds .
l4 intervertebral transforaminal decompression was also performed in the same manner . after removing the fogarty catheter ,
the r - k needle was reinserted and then 3 ml of a mixture of 0.8% lidocaine , 20 mg triamcinolone , and 1,500 iu of hyaluronidase was administered .
after the procedure , however , the patient complained of pain for three days . for the next 15 weeks , the patient reported markedly reduced leg pain ( 2 - 3/10 ) , improved functional status ( 20 - 26% ) and increased claudication distance ( 40 minutes ) .
beginning 16 weeks after treatment , his symptoms recurred , but were more tolerable than those before the treatment .
a 65-year - old male , a farmer , presented with pains in his lower back and right leg in the distribution of l5 dermatome .
his symptoms had started 6 months earlier , but had become aggravated over the previous month .
physical examination showed no weakness in his lower extremities , normal reactions to light touch and pin prick , and normal arterial pulsations .
a lumbar mri scan for back pain one month earlier showed bilateral foraminal stenosis , l4 - 5 and l5-s1 , due to disc protrusion and bulging discs of the entire lumbar spine .
he had been treated with meloxicam 7.5 mg / day and repeated epidural steroid injections ( 4 injections of interlaminar and/or transforaminal epidural blockers ) , but the effects of this treatment persisted for only one month .
a 3 fr fogarty catheter was introduced into the epidural space of his right l5 intervertebral foramen , followed by serial balloon decompression .
after removal of the fogarty catheter , he was administered 3 ml of a mixture of 0.8% lidocaine , 20 mg triamcinolone , and 1,500 iu of hyaluronidase . there were no complications throughout the procedure . over the next 24 weeks , the patient reported no leg pain ( 0/10 ) , markedly improved functional status ( 4 - 8% ) and increased claudication distance ( no limitation to walking ) .
a 77-year - old male , a retired soldier , presented with pain in his lower back , radiating down his right leg in the distribution of l4 dermatome and his left leg in l4 , 5 dermatome .
he had a 3-year history of symptoms , which became aggravated during the previous three months .
motor strength testing showed 4/5 in both quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles , suggesting pain - induced reduction of strength .
he had a tingling sensation and numbness in his lateral calf and experienced leg pain after walking more than 10 m , making him unable to go to the bathroom in his house .
a lumbar mri scan for back pain two years earlier showed degenerative spondylolisthesis of l4 on l5 , causing severe central stenosis , with the cross - sectional area of his dural sac at the narrowest point being 40.4 mm .
lumbar mri also showed stenosis of both lateral recesses and both neural foramens , as well as retrolisthesis of l5 on s1 with disc bulging and facet arthrosis causing left neural foraminal stenosis .
he had been treated with opalmon 15 mg / day , lyrica 150 mg / day , ultracet and a fentanyl patch ( 25 g / hour ) , and had received 17 epidural steroid injections of transforaminal epidural blockers and decompressive neuroplasty . despite these injections and a further increase in analgesic dosage , he reported no improvements in pain and functional status .
he was not indicated for surgery because of his poor general condition , but was regarded as a candidate for spinal cord stimulation .
a 3 fr fogarty catheter was introduced into epidural space of the left l4 , l5 and the right l4 intervertebral foramen , and balloon decompression and drug administration were performed serially . there were no complications throughout the procedure . over the next 24 weeks , the patient reported moderately reduced leg pain ( 3 - 4/10 ) , improved functional status ( 38 - 40% ) and increased claudication distance ( 70 m ) .
although little is known regarding the nonoperative management of spinal stenosis , conservative treatment usually includes physical therapy , nsaids , muscle relaxants and/or mild narcotics , as needed by individual patients .
in addition , local anesthetics and corticosteroids are usually administered to relieve symptoms of persistent pain .
although lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections have not consistently shown efficacy , they may relieve pain in patients with symptoms resulting from inflammation at the interface between the nerve root and the compressing tissues .
epidural injection of steroids is thought to reduce inflammatory edema of the injured nerve root and thus improve intraneural blood flow , decrease sensitization of the dorsal horn neurons and suppress the transmission of nociceptive c - fibers .
local anesthetics induce sympathetic nerve blockade and vasodilation , thereby improving blood flow to the ischemic neural element .
co - administration of hyaluronidase has also been used to enhance the effect of lysis of epidural adhesion .
epidural injection of steroids and local anesthetics in patients with spinal stenosis has been shown to result in only short - lived improvements in pain and function , because the symptoms of spinal stenosis reflect a combination of pathological processes caused by space occupying lesions or fibrosis , such as interruption of blood flow , venous congestion , ischemia , axonal damage and intraneural fibrosis . since serial injections of conventional epidural steroids into our three patients did not result in symptom relief , we utilized an alternative technique focused on resolving the underlying pathophysiology of spinal stenosis , consisting of percutaneous epidural foraminoplasty with 3 fr fogarty catheters , balloon decompression of the epidural space of the intervertebral foramina , and administration of drugs to the target region .
fogarty catheters were initially utilized in thrombectomy to remove fresh , soft emboli and thrombi from arteries and veins .
using its pliable distal tip , designed to minimize trauma to the venous valves , to manipulate around perineural structures enables a relatively safe procedure . instead of inflating with air , however , we used contrast medium , enabling visualization of ballooning and de - ballooning during the procedure .
several factors may be responsible for post - decompression pain relief and functional improvement in our patients .
for example , balloon distension of the epidural space may result in effective mechanical detachment of perineural adhesion , which may play a role in restoring the mobility of the nerve roots to some extent , thus contributing to long - term symptom relief .
moreover , mechanical ballooning of a narrow intervertebral foramen may reduce venous congestion and mechanical irritation .
venous congestion has been regarded essential in precipitating circulatory disturbance , thus inducing neurogenic claudication .
furthermore , initial improvements of symptoms after the decompressive procedure may be due to local anesthetics and steroids that reach the areas causing these symptoms .
balloon dilatation and adhesiolysis , however , may also contribute to the effective delivery of epidural injections to regions of spinal stenosis , thereby improving the effects of drugs in these target lesions .
we found that balloon decompression did not yield consistent results in our patients , which may be due to differences in disease severity and/or physical condition .
patient one achieved 4 months of modest symptom relief , whereas patient two had 6 months symptom - free .
patient three showed incomplete improvement , but this seemed acceptable because this patient was considered a candidate for a spinal cord stimulator .
additional studies involving more patients are needed to establish the proper criteria for selecting patients for balloon decompression .
patient safety should also be considered in the effects of acute compression on spinal nerves .
increasing pressure and its duration have been found to induce more pronounced effects such as intraneural edema .
the safe limits of nerve compression in vivo have not been established , however , transforaminal balloon decompression would be regarded as safe if the balloon pressure is increased slowly and the procedure is limited to less than 2 - 4 h .
there have been previous attempt to use various balloon catheter for epidural adhesiolysis in patients with failed back surgery syndrome . to our knowledge
, however , this is the first report describing the use of epidural balloon catheters to decompress the intervertebral foraminal space in the treatment of patients with spinal stenosis . over the past several years
, minimally invasive surgical techniques have been introduced , using smaller incisions and more limited removal of the innate structure , to achieve decompression .
although our case series provides only anecdotal evidence , the results suggest that transforaminal decompression using a balloon may have potential in the nonsurgical treatment of this condition by modifying the underlying pathophysiology of segmental stenosis .
ongoing randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes will address the effects of this treatment on pain improvement , functional score and claudication distance ."	" lumbar spinal stenosis is a commonly treated with epidural injections of local anesthetics and corticosteroids , however , these therapies may relieve leg pain for weeks to months but do not influence functional status . furthermore , the majority of patients report no substantial symptom change over the repeated treatment . utilizing balloon catheters , we successfully treated with three patients who complained persistent symptoms despite repeated conventional steroid injections . 
 our results suggest that transforaminal decompression using a balloon catheter may have potential in the nonsurgical treatment of spinal stenosis by modifying the underlying pathophysiology . "	"CASE REPORT

DISCUSSION"
20	"an idiopathic epiretinal membrane ( erm ) usually occurs in elderly patients and is usually associated with posterior vitreous detachment ( pvd ) .
a vitrectomy with membrane peeling in symptomatic patients usually results in successful membrane removal with significant improvement of visual function .
a 65-year - old female was referred to our hospital with idiopathic erm of the left eye in july 2003 . her visual acuity was 1.2 in the unaffected right eye and 0.1 with marked distortion in the left eye .
a fundus examination of the left eye revealed a distinct erm , but pvd was not confirmed ( fig .
1a ) . optical coherence tomography ( oct ) demonstrated a partially rolled - up erm , diffuse retinal thickening , and the absence of foveal pit ( fig .
when she was admitted to our hospital for surgery 1 month later , her visual acuity had improved to 0.5 .
a fundus examination showed that pvd had occurred and erm had spontaneously resolved with minimal retinal folds remaining ( fig .
her diagnosis was resolution of the idiopathic erm , which had occurred subsequently to pvd , and we decided to continue observing the patient without surgery .
a fundus examination revealed a semi - transparent erm with a size of about 2 disk diameters ( fig .
an oct scan demonstrated macular thickening with areas of hyporeflective intraretinal cystic spaces and an undulating retinal surface ( fig .
a microscopic examination of the excised specimen showed the characteristic undulating internal limiting membrane ( ilm ) and a continuous sheet of cells overlying the inner surface of the ilm ( fig .
the mechanism of recurrent erm after spontaneous or surgical removal of idiopathic erm is still poorly understood [ 3 , 4 ] .
one possible cause is that the retinal glial cells might migrate and proliferate on the inner retinal surface through the fine defects of the ilm that developed following spontaneous or surgical removal .
another hypothesis is that idiopathic erm removal is incomplete and focal erm remains attached to ilm .
such membrane remnants of idiopathic erm left on the ilm might proliferate and form a new erm .
it is reported that ilm removal during surgery for erm is associated with a better final vision and a lower risk of recurrent erm .
conservative observation is advocated for young subjects with idiopathic erm associated with mild visual disturbance , as spontaneous resolution of idiopathic erm may occur . but physicians should explain to patients the possibility of recurrence , even if idiopathic erm separates spontaneously ."	" we report a case of recurrent epiretinal membrane ( erm ) after spontaneous resolution of an idiopathic erm . a 65-year - old female demonstrated a spontaneous improvement in visual acuity from 0.1 to 1.2 in her left eye attributable to spontaneous resolution of idiopathic erm due to posterior vitreous detachment . 
 thereafter , however , her visual acuity again decreased to 0.2 because of the recurrence of erm . 
 her visual acuity improved to 0.8 after surgical removal . 
 a microscopic examination of the excised specimen showed a characteristic undulating internal limiting membrane ( ilm ) and a continuous sheet of cells overlying the inner surface of the ilm . 
 this case report illustrates that although spontaneous erm resolution is rare , there is a possibility of recurrence even after spontaneous erm resolution . "	"Introduction

23	"frontal fibrosing alopecia represents a peculiar condition originally described by kossard in women in the postmenopause .
the condition presents with a symmetric , marginal alopecia along the frontal and frontotemporal hairline , often with concomitant thinning or complete loss of eyebrows .
affected women typically present with the complaint of asymptomatic , progressive recession of their frontal hairline .
the affected scalp skin is pale and smooth with loss of follicular orifices , often perifollicular erythema and follicular keratinization is observed marking the underlying inflammatory process . since kossard 's original description in 1994 , the number of cases has exploded exponentially worldwide , while its etiology has remained obscure .
based on histopathologic and immunohistochemical studies , kossard et al . eventually interpreted the condition as a frontal variant of lichen planopilaris .
treb and torricelli 's original report of oral lichen planus in a patient with postmenopausal frontal fibrosing alopecia further supported the evidence that the condition actually may represent a variant of lichen planus .
a 60-year - old female patient presented with a history of asymptomatic progressive recession of the frontal hairline and loss of eyebrows .
clinical examination revealed a marginal alopecia along the fronto - temporal hairline and loss of eyebrows [ figure 1 ] .
the affected scalp skin was pale and smooth , loss of follicular orifices , perifollicular erythema , and follicular keratinization .
the nail plate of the right fifth digit demonstrated ridging , fissuring and superficial fragility [ figure 2a ] , the left fifth digit initial atrophy and scarring with pterygium formation [ figure 2b ] .
frontal fibrosing alopecia : symmetric , marginal alopecia along the frontal and frontotemporal hairline , with concomitant thinning or complete loss of eyebrows lichen planus - typical nail involvement ( a ) with superficial nail fragility , and ( b ) pterygium formation a hair pluck ( trichogram ) demonstrated 23% telogen roots and 33% anagen roots without hair root sheaths in the frontal pluck , with normal figures ( telogen rate of 9% , and 18% anagen roots without hair root sheaths ) in the occipital pluck , consistent with androgenetic alopecia .
treatment was started with 0.5 mg oral dutasteride and 0.05% topical clobetasole propionate with reduction of signs of follicular inflammation by dermoscopic examination at 3 months follow - up .
lichen planus is a primary inflammatory disease of the skin , which may affect the mucous membranes , hair follicles , and nails .
when the hair follicle is selectively targeted , it is also referred to as follicular lichen planus or lichen planopilaris .
the cause of lichen planus has largely remained unknown , but it is understood to represent a t - cell mediated autoimmune reaction with an unknown initial trigger , with striking analogies to cutaneous graft - versus - host disease .
when a triggering agent is occasionally identified , this is termed a lichenoid reaction rather than lichen planus . recognized triggering agents include : drugs ( gold salts , beta - blocking agents , antimalarials , thiazide diuretics ) , amalgam tooth fillings ( in lichen planus of the buccal mucosa ) , and hepatitis b or c infection .
since kossard 's original description of postmenopausal frontal fibrosing alopecia in 1994 , zinkernagel and treb reported in 2000 yet another form of fibrosing alopecia in a pattern distribution affecting the centroparietal area of the scalp , histologically with a lichenoid type of follicular inflammation and fibrosis .
the authors addressed the question how the lichenoid tissue reaction is generated around the individual androgenetic hair follicle , and came up with the proposition that follicles with some form of damage or malfunction might express cytokine profiles that attract inflammatory cells to assist in damage repair or in the initiation of apoptosis - mediated organ deletion .
alternatively , an as yet unknown antigenic stimulus from the damaged or malfunctioning hair follicle might initiate a lichenoid tissue reaction in the immunogenetically susceptible individual . ultimately , in 2005 olsen acknowledged existence of clinically significant inflammatory phenomena and fibrosis in androgenetic alopecia and proposed the term  cicatricial pattern hair loss ,  while in 2010 kossard suggested that frontal fibrosing alopecia may hold the key to understanding the complex relationship of pattern alopecia , sex - related differences , and triggers for autoimmune follicular destruction .
eventually , frontal fibrosing alopecia has been recognized to represent a rather generalized than localized process of inflammatory scarring alopecia , with extension beyond the frontotemporal hair line , loss of eyebrows and of eyelashes , loss of peripheral body hair , mucous membrane involvement , and finally , nail involvement . moreover , cutaneous lupus erythematosus has been reported to be capable of mimicking frontal fibrosing alopecia , suggesting that the pattern of clinical disease presentation might be more specific for the condition than the underlying inflammatory autoimmune reaction .
nevertheless , lichen planus remains the single most frequent pathology underlying frontal fibrosing alopecia , and associated lichenoid mucous membrane or nail involvement may provide clues to the underlying pathology .
there is no cure for lichen planus or frontal fibrosing alopecia , but a number of treatments have been proposed to control symptoms or halt disease progression . where androgenetic alopecia represents a co - morbid condition , topical minoxidil and oral dutasteride may be of benefit , in addition to topical and/or systemic anti - inflammatory treatment modalities ( topical or intralesional corticoseroids , topical calcineurin inhibitors , and oral doxycycline , hydroxychloroquine , or mycophenolate mofetil , respectively ) .
the presented case of frontal fibrosing alopecia with nail involvement provides the evidence for underlying lichen planus , whereas favorable response to oral dutasteride may be related to co - morbid androgenetic alopecia ."	" a case of frontal fibrosing alopecia with nail involvement is presented . 
 nail involvement provides evidence for underlying lichen planus , and that the disease represents a rather generalized than localized process . 
 favorable response of the scalp condition to oral dutasteride points to an inflammatory reaction on the background of androgenetic alopecia . "	"INTRODUCTION

25	"primary renal squamous cell carcinoma ( rscc ) is a rare cancer with a variable incidence of about 0.515% of all urothelial cancers [ 14 ] .
there are only isolated case reports and scant case series of such cases in the english literature [ 18 ] .
herein we report four cases of incidentally detected renal pelvis squamous cell carcinomas in patients having a history of staghorn renal calculi with hydronephrosis .

was seen on imaging studies , in all the rest a carcinoma was unsuspected clinically as well as radiologically , and the diagnosis came to light only on histology . in one case ,
the whole kidney was infiltrated with rscc ; however , there was no suspicion of a tumor on radiology even retrospectively .
our series highlights the need for a renal pelvic biopsy and periodic radiological evaluation in patients undergoing treatment for renal stones , as rscc usually escape detection , with dire consequences for the patient , and are only identified incidentally at late stages , when the patient undergoes surgery for a nonfunctioning kidney .

the blood urea was 43  mg / dl and serum creatinine 1.4  mg / dl .
the total glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) was 80% with 11.2% on the right side and 89% on the left side .
x - ray of the kidney , ureter and bladder ( kub ) showed presence of bilateral renal calculi with presence of staghorn calculi in the right kidney and multiple small calculi in the left kidney .
the patient underwent a right nephrectomy for right - sided nonfunctioning kidney . on gross examination the kidney
was enlarged and showed a dilated pelvi - calyceal system , presence of calculi in the lumen , and thinning of the renal parenchyma to a narrow peripheral rim .

the patient was referred to our hospital for confirmation of the diagnosis and further management .
cancers of the kidney and renal pelvis are the ninth most common malignant cancer and form the 12th most common cause of all cancer - related deaths . of all urothelial tumors ,
only 5 - 6% occur in the upper urinary tract ( renal pelvis and ureter ) , and of these only about 615% are squamous cell carcinomas . among malignant renal tumors ,
scc are decidedly rare neoplasms and form only about 0.58% [ 13 , 9 , 10 ] .
over one year ( 1st january 2010 to 31st december 2010 ) , 15 patients with hydronephrosis and nonfunctioning kidney were operated at our hospital and one case of such an operation was sent to us for review . of these 16 cases ,
on reviewing all malignant renal tumors diagnosed in our department during the same time period , we found that rscc comprised 4/21 cases ( 19% ) .
the remaining cases comprised 11 cases of clear cell adenocarcinoma ( 52% ) , two cases of papillary adenocarcinoma ( 9.5% ) , and one case each of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma , one case of collecting duct carcinoma , one case of wilm 's tumor , and one case of transitional cell carcinoma ( 4.8% each ) .
the relatively high incidence of rscc in our series could be due to the referral pattern of our hospital , which is a tertiary care referral institute .  
table 1 shows the various clinical features and pathological findings of the cases in the present series .  
most of the current data of rscc is derived from small case series , over time periods ranging from 6 years to 27 years , and few isolated case reports [ 18 ] .
the predisposing factors leading to development of rscc are chronic irritation due to preexisting renal stones ( most commonly of the staghorn type ) or prior surgery for renal stones , analgesic abuse , or radiotherapy .
chronic irritation induced by the aforementioned conditions , superimposed by infection , is believed to induce squamous metaplasia and subsequent development of leukoplakia and neoplasia in the urothelium , resulting in rscc [ 18 , 11 ] .  
clinically , the mean age of presentation is 56 years , and contrary to earlier reports , there is equal incidence in males and females .
the involvement is unilateral , equally common on the right and left sides . presenting symptoms include loin pain , hematuria , and abdominal lump [ 1 , 2 , 4 ]
. history of previous surgery for renal stone or staghorn calculi in patients of rscc has been reported variably from only 12.3% of cases in one series to 100% of cases in others [ 2 , 4 ] .
li and cheung   reported an incidence of rscc in 2% of patients with recurrent renal stones . in the present series ,
the mean age was 60 years , m  :  f ratio was 3  :  1 , right side to - left - side ratio was 1  :  1 , and most common presenting symptom was flank pain .
hematuria was observed in only one of our patients and may have been due to renal stones .
this is similar to the study by li and cheung . in all of our cases ( 100% )
there was presence of staghorn type of renal stones . in two of our four cases ( 50% )
there was history of prior surgery for renal stones and three out of four patients ( 75% ) had a history of bilateral renal calculi .  
significantly , due to nonspecific and insidious presenting symptoms such as flank pain and hematuria , which often overlap with symptoms of renal stones , lack of specific radiological features , and rarity of this tumor , most cases of rscc are undiagnosed preoperatively and come to light only on histopathological examination of the excised non functioning kidney [ 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 12 ] .
a retrospective review of radiological findings in rscc showed that conventional radiological findings of filling defects , obstructive lesions or nonfunctioning kidney by intravenous urography ( ivu ) , which have been documented sporadically in   the literature , are all nonspecific .
because of this , a renal tumor usually remains unsuspected and further radiological evaluation such as computerised tomography ( ct ) is not done routinely in every case , especially in developing countries , where the cost of these investigations is an issue .
even ct imaging does not help in exact diagnosis , but may provide helpful information regarding the anatomical extent of the tumor .
found that the most helpful features in ct of rscc were presence of enhancing extraluminal and exophytic mass and , in some cases , an intraluminal component .
they further suggested , that as it is impractical to perform ct for every patient with renal stone , ivu should be done periodically , especially in long standing stones , and should be read as a split function test for all portions of renal parenchyma . in such cases , filling defects , delay in appearance of pyelogram , or renal parenchymal thickening should be regarded as renal tumor despite the   absence of mass effects and preservation of renal contour , warranting further studies by ct or biopsy from renal pelvis or calyces during treatment for renal stones . in the present series , similar to the literature ,
due to nonspecific clinical and radiological features , there was lack of confirmed preoperative diagnosis of a renal tumor in all our cases . in 3 of our 4 cases ,
ct was not done preoperatively as clinically , and on conventional radiology such as x - ray , ultrasonography , and ivu , the diagnosis was non functioning kidney with staghorn calculi and hydronephrosis . in 2 of these 3 cases ( cases 1 and 2 ) ,
gross inspection showed only focal areas of thickening of pelvis which were extensively sampled and microscopic examination proved them to be rscc . in the third case , even though the diagnosis was evident on gross examination of the resected specimen , as almost the whole kidney was replaced by the tumor , even a retrospective radiological review did not show any evidence of a tumor , much to the surprise of our radiologists . in the fourth case , though no tumor was suspected clinically , a ct scan was performed and revealed a suspicious nodule present intraluminally in the region of the pelvis and histological examination advised .
hence our series underlines the fact that rscc may be missed , clinically as well as radiologically , in a high number of cases , and the diagnosis may only be incidental during microscopic examination , provided extensive sampling of the kidney , particularly of the renal pelvis , has been done , specially if there is any area of thickening .
due to the above - mentioned reasons , most patients of rscc present at late stages , accounting for the poor prognosis [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 12 ] .
compared rscc with urothelial carcinomas ( ucs ) and found that though there was no significant difference in prognosis in advanced stage ( pt3 and pt4 ) rscc and uc , more patients of rscc presented at advanced stage ( 94% ) than uc ( 37% ) .
hence , the outcome of rscc patients is poor with median survival of only 57 months after surgery and less than 10% alive after 5 years [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ] . in the present series ,
similarly three of our four patients ( 75% ) presented at advanced stage ( pt3 and pt4 ) . in one of the patients with stage pt3 ,
the nodal status was also advanced ( pn2 ) , upstaging the patient to stage iv .
only case 3 , the 50-year - old female , had a lower stage ( pt2 ) .  
histologically , nearly a fourth of rscc also shows other histological patterns focally including micropapillary , lymphoepithelial , small cell , and sarcomatoid .
rscc with solid and papillary pattern has been seen in 14% of cases in one large series , and most cases are high grade . in our series , one of the four cases ( 25% ) showed a mixed solid and papillary pattern .
two cases were of well - differentiated scc ( 50% ) ,   one of   moderate ( 25% ) and   one of poorly differentiated scc ( 25% ) .
radical nephroureterectomy with excision of bladder cuff is the treatment of choice in patients without metastasis ; however , in view of the unifocal nature of this disease , parenchyma sparing surgeries have also been proposed [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 12 ] .
cisplatinum - based adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are usually given due to the advanced stage and poor prognosis in most patients but have shown no survival benefit , highlighting the need for early diagnosis [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 ] .
one of our patients was lost to follow up , one died of intercurrent cad while the remaining two ( one pt2 and the other pt3 ) were on cisplatinum - based chemotherapy and surviving three and five months after surgery , respectively .
primary rsccs are rare tumors and show a strong association with renal stones , which might confound diagnosis
. they may not be radiologically detectable and the first indication of malignancy might come incidentally on histological examination of nephrectomy for nonfunctioning hydronephrotic calculous kidney .
this emphasises the necessity of prompt treatment of renal stones and assessment for renal tumors in patients with long - standing staghorn calculi .
the high incidence of rscc in hydronephrotic kidneys in our series also highlights the need for meticulous sampling of the renal pelvis by the pathologist in such specimens ."	" squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis is a rare neoplasm , often unsuspected clinically due to its rarity and ambiguous clinical and radiological features , and hence patients present at advanced stages resulting in poor prognosis . 
 we report here four cases of incidentally diagnosed primary renal squamous cell carcinoma , treated at our hospital over a short span of one year , and review the relevant literature . 
 mean age of the patients ( 3 males , 1 female ) was 60 years . 
 all suffered from staghorn stones . 
 interestingly , renal carcinoma was unsuspected clinically in all patients . in one case , a computerised tomography scan showed a suspicious nodule . 
 all underwent nephrectomy for nonfunctioning kidney . in just two cases , 
 tumor was identified on gross examination , while the other two only showed thickened pelvis . 
 our series emphasises the need for pelvicalyceal biopsy during treatment for long - standing nephrolithiasis , and thorough sampling of the renal pelvis in nephrectomy specimen of such patients . "	"1. Introduction

4. Conclusion"
27	"the diabetes control and complications trial1 and the kumamoto study2 have shown that intensive insulin therapy and the resulting improvements in glycemic control reduce the incidence and delay the progression of microvascular complications .
however , neutral protamine hagedorn ( nph ) insulin , which was used as basal insulin in these studies , has several limitations . of note ,
its duration of action is only 812 hours , with a peak in action occurring within 46 hours after subcutaneous administration , thus increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.37 indeed , some patients complain of hypoglycemia before dawn , necessitating a reduction in the nph insulin dose at bedtime .
however , reducing the nph insulin dose at bedtime increases the blood glucose level in the morning .
additionally , nph insulin is a suspension , which must be thoroughly resuspended before injection , and inadequate resuspension results in a very large day - to - day glycemic variability of action.8,9 therefore , to achieve tight glycemic control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia , insulin preparations with a long duration of action and low day - to - day glycemic variability in terms of glucose - lowering action are needed .
insulin glargine4,6,10 and insulin detemir5,7,11,12 are basal insulin analogs of the dissolution type that have flatter profiles and longer duration of action compared with nph insulin
. however , there is controversy over which insulin analog has the longer and more stable action .
therefore , in this study , the aim was to compare the glucose - lowering effect and glycemic stability of insulin glargine with those of insulin detemir using continuous glucose monitoring ( cgm ) .
diabetic patients who were prescribed basal - bolus insulin therapy with nph insulin as basal insulin at bedtime for 1 year or more were enrolled in the study .
patients who injected nph insulin two or more times per day , with proteinuria > 1.0 g / day , serum creatinine > 132 mol / l ( men ) or 106
mol / l ( women ) , abnormal aspartate aminotransferase/ alanine aminotransferase elevation ( > 3 the upper limit of normal ) , myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months prior to study entry , or hba1c
all patients received an explanation of the procedures and possible disadvantages of participating in the study and gave written informed consent prior to entry .
this study was approved by the institutional review board of kitasato institute hospital and was performed in accordance with the declaration of helsinki .
patients were randomized using a computer to either sequence a ( nph insulin was first switched to insulin glargine , then to insulin detemir ) or sequence b ( insulin detemir followed by insulin glargine ) . the patient s prior nph insulin was discontinued and replaced with the allocated long - acting insulin analog ( insulin glargine or insulin detemir ) .
patients were asked to continue their other antihyperglycemic medications and to not change their dosage throughout the study . to compare insulin glargine with insulin detemir under the same conditions , the dose of the long - acting insulin analogs was the same as that of nph , and the doses of bolus insulin ( insulin lispro or insulin aspart ) were not changed .
the cgm examination , of 72 hours in duration from 12 pm on day 1 to 12 pm on day 4 , was carried out at least 5 days after switching insulin .
the study drugs were crossed over on the day when the first cgm examination ended . the cgm sensor ( cgms system gold ; medtronic , northridge , ca )
patients were instructed to measure their capillary blood glucose using finger sticks , at least four times per day ( at mealtimes and at bedtime ) .
the outcomes of this study included determining the effectiveness of each type of insulin on glycemic control and glycemic variability .
glycemic control was estimated as the mean blood glucose ( mbg ) , the area under the glucose curve above 7.8 or 10.0 mmol / l ( area under the curve [ auc]>7.8,10 ) , and the percentage of time above 7.8 or 10.0mmol / l ( t>7.8,10 ) . the auc was calculated using the trapezoidal method .
intraday glycemic variability was assessed as the standard deviation ( sd ) and the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions ( mage ) .
the sd around the mean glucose values is considered the  gold standard  assessment of intraday glycemic variability.13 mage , described by service et al,14 is probably more appropriate for selecting the major glucose swings that are calculated as the arithmetic mean of differences between consecutive peaks and nadirs , provided that the differences are greater than the sd around the mean values.13 day - to - day glycemic variability was assessed as the mean of daily difference ( modd ) .
modd , described by molnar et al,15 is the mean of the absolute difference between glucose values taken on 2 consecutive days at the same time .
hypoglycemia , which was defined as a sensor value of 3.9 mmol / l , was also calculated as a total time at 3.9
the differences between two insulin analogs were analyzed using the wilcoxon rank - sum test .
spss software 14.0j ( spss japan inc , tokyo , japan ) was used for all statistical analyses .

modd , described by molnar et al,15 is the mean of the absolute difference between glucose values taken on 2 consecutive days at the same time .
mmol / l , was also calculated as a total time at 3.9 mmol / l .
the differences between two insulin analogs were analyzed using the wilcoxon rank - sum test .
spss software 14.0j ( spss japan inc , tokyo , japan ) was used for all statistical analyses .
a total of eleven japanese patients , six with type 1 and five with type 2 diabetes , were enrolled between may 2008 and june 2009 .
because of an alert for insulin glargine issued by the european association for the study of diabetes,16 this study was discontinued and the available data was analyzed .
two patients were excluded from analysis because of protocol violation ( misuse of nph ) .
therefore , nine patients ( five in sequence a and four in sequence b ) completed the study .
mbg , as calculated from cgm values , was significantly lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir ( 9.6  2.4
mmol / l versus 10.4  2.8 mmol / l , p = 0.038 ) ( type 1 : 11.0  2.5
mmol / l ; type 2 : 8.4  1.8 mmol / l versus 9.0  2.2
in addition , auc>10 and auc>7.8 were significantly lower with insulin glargine versus insulin detemir ( table 2 ) .
the sd was significantly lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir . however , the mage value was not significantly different between the two insulin analogs ( table 3 ) .
the modd value was significantly lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir ( 2.2  1.1 mmol / l vs 3.6  1.7 mmol / l , p = 0.011 ; figure 2 ) ( type 1 : 2.7  1.2 mmol / l vs
4.7  1.8 mmol / l ; type 2 : 1.8  0.9 mmol / l vs 2.7  0.9 mmol / l ) .
there was no difference between the two insulin analogs in terms of the total hypoglycemic time .
this lack of a difference remained even after separating the results according to daytime and nighttime values .

there was no difference between the two insulin analogs in terms of the total hypoglycemic time .
this lack of a difference remained even after separating the results according to daytime and nighttime values .
in this study , the glucose - lowering effect and glucose stability of insulin glargine was compared with those of insulin detemir using cgm .
glycemic control parameters , such as mbg , auc>10 , and auc>7.8 , were better with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir .
the present study suggests that insulin glargine has a greater glucose - lowering effect than insulin detemir at the same dose .
the difference in glucose - lowering effect can be compensated for by increasing the insulin dose but there might be a difference in the cost - effectiveness and hypoglycemic episode . because the same tendency was found in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes ( mbg in type 1 : insulin glargine , 11.0  2.5
mmol / l versus insulin detemir , 12.2  2.7 mmol / l ; type 2 : 8.4  1.8
mmol / l ) , to maintain statistical power , the two types of diabetes were not distinguished .
these findings suggest that , if higher doses of insulin detemir are administered to achieve equivalent glycemic control to insulin glargine , the hypoglycemic time might increase .
furthermore , the intraday and day - to - day glycemic variability of insulin glargine was compared with those of insulin detemir .
the results of cgm revealed that sd and modd were lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir .
these findings suggest that insulin glargine might have better glycemic variability compared with insulin detemir .
it is expected that the risk of hypoglycemia is lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir , if the aim of treatment is near - normal glycemia .
several previous studies have compared insulin glargine with insulin detemir.1729 three studies using insulin - clamp tests yielded very conflicting results.1719 heise et al reported that the same doses ( 0.4 u / kg ) of insulin glargine and insulin detemir are very similar in terms of the mean shape of their pharmacodynamic profiles and duration of action in patients with type 1 diabetes.17 they also reported that the day - to - day glycemic variability is lower with insulin detemir .
klein et al reported a similar duration of action and lower day - to - day glycemic variability with insulin detemir versus insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes ( 0.81.6 u / kg).18 by contrast , porcellati et al reported that 0.35 u / kg of insulin detemir has similar effects to the same dose of insulin glargine during the first 12 hours , and that the metabolic effects of insulin detemir are lower at 1224 hours.19 six clinical studies have compared insulin glargine with insulin detemir . in five studies ,
in which all patients or more than half of the patients were injected with insulin detemir twice daily , glycemic control was similar to that of once - daily insulin glargine.2024 the other study , in which the majority ( 87.4% ) of patients were injected with insulin detemir once a day , suggested inferiority of glycemic control for insulin detemir versus once - daily insulin glargine.25 these clinical studies clearly showed that , at similar daily doses , insulin detemir has a shorter action time and weaker action than insulin glargine .
these findings are consistent with the results of the present study and with the results of a clamp study reported by porcellati et al.19 tone et al compared the day - to - day glycemic variability of insulin glargine with that of insulin detemir.26 however , cgm was not used and the study evaluated only fasting plasma glucose ; therefore , the study was inconclusive .
however , king et al and wiesli et al have reported comparisons of insulin glargine with insulin detemir using cgm .
although these studies concluded that once - daily insulin detemir provided 24-hour glycemic control similar to that of insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes , did glycemic variability was not reported.2729 to the best of the present authors knowledge , the present study is the first to show that insulin glargine has better glycemic variability than insulin detemir based on cgm .
first , because of the alert for insulin glargine , it was deemed inappropriate to continue enrolling patients to receive insulin glargine .
therefore , the number of subjects enrolled was too small to reach a definitive conclusion and patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were combined . however , as shown in figure 2 , most of the patients had lower modd values with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir .
in fact , our finding of lower modd was consistent after stratification for the type of diabetes ( insulin glargine versus insulin detemir , type 1 : 2.7  1.2
mmol / l versus 4.7  1.8 mmol / l ; type 2 : 1.8  0.9
second , the doses of basal insulin used in the present study were different from those used in the earlier clinical studies .
the average basal insulin dose was 0.24 u / kg / day in this study ( type 1 : 0.22 u / kg / day ; type 2 : 0.26 u / kg / day ) , which was much lower than in earlier clinical studies ( insulin glargine : 0.33210.7525 u / kg / day ; insulin detemir : 0.40210.8223 u / kg / day ) .
the doses of basal insulin used in our study are similar to those used in the japanese national phase iii program for insulin glargine for japanese patients with type 1 diabetes ( mean : 0.21 u / kg / day)30 and insulin detemir for japanese patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes ( mean : 0.27 u / kg / day).31 therefore , the insulin dose in the present study appears to be appropriate for japanese patients .
the results of the present study suggest that insulin glargine provides more effective and more stable glycemic control than insulin detemir . because this study was too small to make a final conclusion , however , large - scale studies are required to confirm these findings ."	" objective : this study aimed to compare the glucose - lowering effect and glycemic variability of insulin glargine with those of insulin detemir.material and methods : this was an open - label , single - center , randomized , two - way crossover study in patients with diabetes on basal - bolus insulin therapy , with neutral protamine hagedorn ( nph ) insulin as basal insulin . 
 patients switched from nph insulin to a course either of insulin glargine followed by insulin detemir , or insulin detemir followed by insulin glargine , continuing the same dose of the prior bolus of insulin . to evaluate the glucose - lowering effect , 
 daily glycemic profiles were recorded for 72 hours by continuous glucose monitoring ( cgm ) in an outpatient setting . 
 the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions , standard deviation ( sd ) , and the mean of daily difference ( modd ) were used to assess intraday and day - to - day glycemic variability.results:eleven patients were enrolled and nine completed the study . mean blood glucose calculated from cgm values was significantly lower with insulin glargine compared with insulin detemir ( 9.6 
  2.4 mmol / l versus 10.4  2.8 mmol / l , p = 0.038 ) . 
 the sd was significantly lower with insulin glargine versus insulin detemir ( 2.5  0.9 mmol / l vs 3.5  1.6 mmol / l , p = 0.011 ) . 
 the modd value was significantly lower with insulin glargine than with insulin detemir ( 2.2  1.1 mmol / l vs 3.6  1.7 mmol / l , p = 0.011 ) . 
 there was no significant difference between the two insulin analogs in terms of hypoglycemia.conclusion:this study suggests that insulin glargine leads to more effective and more stable glycemic control than the same dose of insulin detemir . "	"Introduction

Conclusion"
29	"it has the ability to cause a variety of infections in numerous ecological niches within the host .
it colonizes the nares , axillae , vagina , pharynx , or damaged skin surfaces and causes a variety of suppurative ( pus - forming ) infections and toxinoses in humans . besides this ,
s. aureus is arguably the dominant organism implicated in primary infertility , among males and females alike .
s. aureus has been observed as causative organism accounting for 68.2% of seminal fluid infections .
this is consistent with that reported by okon et al . , where s. aureus was isolated from 62.5% of the seminal fluids
. s. aureus has also been reported to be commonly isolated microorganism from cervical samples .
studied the influence of different uropathogenic microorganisms on human sperm motility parameters by means of casa and reported that s. aureus retards the sperm motility .
similar studies were done by liu et al . on the effect of certain uropathogenic microorganisms on human sperm motility parameters and found significant decrease in sperm motility when spermatozoa were coincubated with s. aureus .
some authors have suggested that direct interaction between bacteria and spermatozoa facilitates immobilization of spermatozoa [ 79 ] , while others have reported evidence for soluble spermicidal factor produced and secreted by bacteria in the extracellular medium .   in an earlier work done in our laboratory ,
we have also been able to isolate a strain of s. aureus from cervix of an infertile woman , causing 100% immobilization of spermatozoa without agglutination .
motility of spermatozoa requires energy in the form of atp   that is provided by sperm mitochondria to power the flagellar motion that propels the sperm to the site of fertilization .
it thus seems possible that the inhibition of sperm motility after treatment with sif may be due to decrease in the atpase activity or imbalance in the molecules of biological significance .
further , the analysis of acrosome reaction in human sperm is recommended to estimate the fertilization ability of human sperm in the clinical field .
further characterization of both sif and sif binding receptor will help in better understanding of sif and receptor interactions which can be aimed as a potential candidate for treatment of unexplained infertility .
semen samples were obtained from males attending infertility clinic at government multispeciality hospital , sector 16 , chandigarh , by masturbation into sterile wide mouth container . only ejaculates showing normal semen parameters according to who criteria   were used .
a preparation of washed sperm samples was done , in which the sperm cell pellet was retained after centrifugation at 500  rpm for 10  min and thereafter it was washed twice with sterile phosphate buffer saline ( pbs ) ( 50  mm , ph 7.2 ) .
cervical swabs were taken from 16 women below the age of 35 years , suffering from unexplained infertility attending the department of obstetrics and gynaecology at government multispeciality hospital , sector 16 , chandigarh .
samples were streaked on blood agar plates and the plates were incubated aerobically at 37c for 2448  h. isolates were identified according to the bergey 's manual of determinative bacteriology .
microorganisms were identified up to genus level only . in total , 27 isolates were obtained . amongst the various isolates , staphylococcus ( 51.85% ) was the predominant organism present . when the effect of 24 and 48  h old cell culture and cell free supernatant of cervical isolates on human sperm motility was studied in vitro
, the results showed that 17 out of 27 isolates ( 63% ) significantly decreased sperm motility .
one of the isolate causing 100% immobilization of spermatozoa was selected for further studies . only this strain was further identified by biochemical tests and was found to be coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus .
sif was extracted and purified from 72  h old cell culture of s. aureus by the method previously standardized in the laboratory .
briefly , the cell culture of s. aureus grown in brain heart infusion ( bhi ) broth , under shake conditions ( 220  rpm ) at 37c for 72  h , was centrifuged at 5,000  rpm for 15  min at 4c .
sif was purified from the supernatant by ammonium sulphate precipitation , gel permeation chromatography , and ion exchange chromatography . to check the purification status , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( page )
following page , protein band was excised and gel piece was washed once with 100  l hplc grade water for 10  min and then destained in 100  l of destaining solution 1 ( 50% 100  mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile ) by incubating at 37c for 30  min . destaining solution was discarded and gel piece was dehydrated in 100  l of acetonitrile ( acn ) at 37c for 5  min and then air dried for 5  min at 37c .
the gel piece was reduced in 150  l of 10  mm of dithiothreitol ( dtt)/100  mm of ammonium bicarbonate by incubating at 56c for 30  min .
it was then alkylated in 100  l of 50  mm iodoacetamide/100  mm ammonium bicarbonate in dark for 30  min and alkylation buffer was discarded .
gel piece was washed with 100  l destaining solution , removed , and again dehydrated with 100  l acn for 5  min and then air dried at 37c for 5  min .
gel piece was rehydrated in ~5  l trypsin solution ( 20  ng  l ) for 10  min at 37c .
gel piece was incubated at 37c for 16  h.   to extract the peptides after the overnight incubation , ~20  l peptide extraction solution ( 1% trifluoroacetic acid , tfa ) was added and sonicated in a water bath sonicator for 5 min .
a 6  l solution was injected for analysis with lc - ms / ms ( agilent , palo alto , ca , usa ) .
data was analyzed using agilent ion trap analysis software version 5.2 and proteins were identified by database search against the mascot database .
mg atpase activity of spermatozoa was studied according to kielley   and chappel   with slight modifications .
tris - hcl ( 0.2 m , ph 7.6 ) washed spermatozoa ( 1  10/ml ) were sonicated at 50  hz for 10  min ( 10 cycles of 30s with 1  min interval ) at 4c . the reaction mixture for atpase consisted of 0.2  ml tris - hclbuffer ( 0.2 m , ph 7.6 ) , 0.2  ml of mgcl2 ( 5  mm ) , 0.2  ml of atp ( 6  mg  ml ) , and 0.2  ml of sonicated sperm suspension .
different concentrations of sif ( 12.5  g , 25  g , 50  g , and 100  g ) were added to the reaction mixture .
the mixture was incubated at 37c for 1  h. after this period of incubation , the reaction was stopped by adding 1  ml of cold 10% trichloroacetic acid ( tca ) and then incubated at 4c overnight for protein precipitation .
the control tubes contained all the components of the reaction mixture but tca was added in the beginning to stop the atpase activity .
inorganic phosphorus ( pi ) released was determined according to the method of boyce et al . .
one unit of atpase is expressed as g of the pi released after 1  h of incubation .
the experiment was repeated thrice . the semen sample after liquefaction was washed twice ( 500  rpm , 5  min ) with human tubal fluid medium ( htfm ) containing 1% human serum albumin ( hsa ) .
sperm concentration was adjusted to 40  10  ml and sperm suspension was divided into two aliquots ( test and control ) .
the test sample was incubated for 3  h at 37c with equal volumes of sif , whereas the control was prepared by adding equal volume of pbs ( 50  mm , ph 7.2 ) under same conditions .
after 3  h , spermatozoa from both test and control were treated with either 0.1% dmso ( spontaneous acrosome reaction ) or 10  m calcium ionophore a23187 ( induced acrosome reaction ) for 1  h at 37c .
subsequently , spermatozoa were washed in htfm without hsa ( 500  rpm , 10  min ) .
the pellet was resuspended in 3% glutaraldehyde and incubated for 20  min at 37c .
after further washing the pellet was resuspended in 1050  l htfm and smeared onto a slide . after drying
, spermatozoa were stained in bismark brown ( 0.8% in deionized water , ph 1.8 ) for 5  min , washed three times with water , and stained with rose bengal ( 0.8% in 0.1 m tris buffer , ph 5.6 ) for 25  min .
after second washing procedure , spermatozoa were dehydrated in 50% , 70% , and 96% ethanol rinsed with water , and examined at 1000x magnification under light microscope .
purified ligand was conjugated to fitc using fitc labeling kit ( genei fitc labelling kit bangalore genei ( india ) pvt . ltd . ) .
1  mg of purified ligand was mixed with fitc according to f / p ratio as per the instructions given in the kit .
liquefied semen sample was washed twice with pbs and the pellet was finally suspended in 500  l of pbs . to 100  l of sperm suspension , 200  l of conjugated ligand was added and incubated at 37c for 1  h. then 150  l of 3% formaldehyde was added and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37c for 1  h. after incubation , the reaction mixture was washed thrice with pbs .
the pellet was finally dissolved in 50  l of pbs ( 50  mm , ph 7.2 ) . a wet mount was prepared and observed under fluorescent microscope 1000x magnification .
sif receptor was extracted from human spermatozoa by the method previously standardized in the laboratory .
briefly , the receptor was extracted by treating washed spermatozoa with 3 m nacl for 4  h at 37c under shaking conditions .
3 m nacl - treated sperm sample was centrifuged at 1500  rpm for 15  min and then dialyzed extensively against pbs ( 50  mm , ph 7.2 ) under cold conditions .
the purification of the receptor was further done using gel filtration chromatography and the purity of this preparation was checked by native page .  
processing of protein bands , tryptic digestion , and peptide extraction was done in the same way as described earlier for lc - ms of sif .
1  l peptide solution ( peptide extracts after tryptic digestion ) and 1  l of a suitable matrix , for example , alpha - cyano hydroxycinnamic acid ( hcca ) in 1  :  2 v / v of acetonitrile ( acn ) : 0.1% tfa , were mixed nicely
. 1  l of this mixture was spotted on a maldi target plate and allowed to air dry at room temperature .
maldi target plate was loaded into ultraflex maldi - tof for subsequent peptide spectra acquisition and analysis .
a laser power of 337  nm wavelength was used for ionization of the samples spotted on the target plate .
peptide peaks were calibrated with peaks obtained from the peptide calibration standard . after peptide spectra were obtained , ms analysis was carried out using flex analysis software ( v 2.2 , bruker ) .
subsequent ms data analysis was carried out using biotools software ( v 2.2 , bruker ) and mascot search engine ( matrix science ) against the ncbi database .
the enthalpy of binding of ligand with the receptor was determined in pbs using a microreaction calorimeter .
an amount of 1.5  ml of receptor ( 200  g  ml ) in buffer was placed in each of the calorimetric vials and 250  l syringe ( speed 3  l  sec ) was loaded with the ligand ( 500  g  ml ) .
the binding constant , k , and enthalpy of binding , h were computed by using iterative nonlinear least square regression method .

 s. aureus isolated from the cervix of a woman with unexplained infertility inhibited sperm motility by secreting the factor extracellularly .
purified sif was a protein of about 20  kda with remarkable sperm immobilization activity . according to lc - ms measurements of the 20  kda band , the protein showed the peptide sequence similarity with hsp-70 protein when matched with proteins in the ncbinr database , using the mascot search program .
the search yielded a top score of 143 for hsp-70 like protein as shown by the histogram of the score distribution for the 20 best matching proteins .
protein scores greater than 57 ( p < 0.05 ) were considered to be significant .
the effect of purified sif from s. aureus on the mg adenosine triphosphatase activity of pooled and sonicated spermatozoa from human was studied . from the results ( table 1 )
, it could be observed that the sif inhibited mg atpase activity of spermatozoa in dose - dependent manner . at a concentration of 100  g  ml of sif
, there was no detectable mg atpase activity , whereas at lower concentration of 50  g  ml of sif , atpase activity decreased from 931.7  1.3 units ( control ) to 195.23  2.3 units .   when the effect of sif on human sperm acrosome reaction was studied two patterns of staining
red or pink staining of the acrosomal region indicated intact acrosomes , whereas white , brown , or yellowish acrosomes were interpreted as acrosome - reacted .
the percentages of spontaneously acrosome reacted spermatozoa in sif - treated samples were comparable to control ( dmso ) . on treatment with calcium ionophore , majority ( approx .
however , spermatozoa incubated with sif in htfm ( with 1% hsa ) failed to undergo acrosome reaction in response to calcium ionophore challenge ( figure 1 ) . when sperm samples treated with fitc labelled sif were observed under fluorescent microscope , bright green fluorescence was seen over the spermatozoa which depicts the binding of sif with spermatozoa .
this indicates that some receptors might be present on the surface of spermatozoa to which sif binds ( figure 2 ) .   according to maldi - tof analysis of the purified 62  kda band ,
the protein showed the peptide sequence similarity with mhc class ii antigen when the resulting spectrum was used to search for matching proteins in the ncbinr database , using the mascot search program .
the search yielded a top score of 68 for mhc class ii antigen ( protein scores greater than 66 are significant ; p < 0.05 ) .  
the binding constant , k ( 1350/m ) , and enthalpy of binding , h , ( 11.9  kj  mole ) were computed from the experimentally calculated enthalpy of interaction between ligand and receptor , using iterative nonlinear least square regression method ( table 2 ) .
the values of free energy and entropy were found to be 18.57  kj  mole and 21.53  j  molek , respectively , calculated from the following equations : 
 ( 1)g=  rtlnk,s=(hg)t .

 s. aureus is an aggressive , opportunistic gram - positive pathogen that colonizes the skin , anterior nares , axillae , pharynx , and urogenital tract of 20% of healthy humans .
jiang and lu reported s. aureus as the predominant flora in infertile men with a significant decrease in sperm motility .   in an earlier work done in our laboratory ,
s. aureus causing immobilization of human spermatozoa was isolated from the cervix of a woman with unexplained infertility , and a sperm immobilization factor ( sif ) was purified .
reported that heat shock proteins ( hsp ) are immunodominant antigens of numerous microbial pathogens , for example , chlamydia trachomatis , which have been recognized as the main cause of infertility .   to further elucidate the contribution of sif to reproductive failure ,
the effect of purified sif from s. aureus on the mg atpase activity of spermatozoa was studied and the results showed that sif decreased the atpase activity .
there was no detectable mg atpase activity when spermatozoa were incubated with sif at concentration of 100  g  ml .
any agent affecting atpase activity of sperms affects the motility of spermatozoa making it incapable of fertilization .
for example , in case of sea urchin spermatozoa , it was observed that motile sperm had an atpase activity of 0.16  m pi ( min  mg protein ) , while sperm that had been rendered nonmotile by homogenizing had an activity of 0.045  m pi ( min  mg protein ) , suggesting inhibition of mg - dependent atpase could be one of the possible mechanisms of sperm immobilization .
although the rate of spontaneous acrosomal reaction of spermatozoa does not correlate with the success rate of in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) , the index of inducibility , measured by the difference between induced ( after incubation with calcium ionophore or exposure to low temperature ) and spontaneous acrosomal reaction , is of prognostic value for sperm fertilization capacity .
when the effect of sif on human spermatozoa was studied , it was found that the percentages of acrosome - reacted spermatozoa obtained in tests treated with sif were consistently lower than those obtained in calcium ionophore - treated samples ( positive control ) .
bacteria including ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis have been demonstrated to have a negative effect on ionophore - induced acrosomal reaction of human spermatozoa in vitro [ 26 , 27 ] .
el - mulla et al . also studied the effect of e. coli on acrosomal reaction of spermatozoa .
it was shown that the inducibility of the acrosome reaction was significantly lower in semen samples pretreated with e. coli than in the control samples .
the results demonstrated that e. coli affect the inducibility of the acrosome reaction in vitro and may impair the fertilizing capacity of human spermatozoa .
several studies have found that sperm responsiveness to acrosome reaction inducers is reduced in infertile patients .
therefore , sif inhibiting the induction of acrosome reaction may be impairing the fertilizing capacity of human spermatozoa . from the results it appears that the effect of sif on inhibition of mg atpase may be separate from ionophore
mediated acrosome reaction as disrupted spermatozoa were used for the estimation of mg atpase activity while intact spermatozoa were evaluated for acrosome reaction .
further , when the fluorescent microscopy of spermatozoa incubated with fitc labelled sif was done , bright green fluorescence was seen over the spermatozoa surface .
this binding between sif and spermatozoa gives direct evidence that some kind of receptors might be present on the surface of spermatozoa to which labelled sif binds .
therefore , in the present study , an attempt was made to extract , purify , and characterize the receptor from spermatozoa that is responsible for its interaction with sif produced by s. aureus .
maldi - tof studies of receptor indicated that receptor shows sequence similarity with mhc class ii antigen when matched with ncbinr database .
these results are in agreement with those of earlier studies by morimoto et al . who clearly demonstrated the expression of the major histocompatibility complex ( mhc ) class ii molecules on murine sperm cells by means of radioimmunoassay as well as by enzyme immunoassay .
the study revealed that the site of sperm for binding foreign dna was mediated by the complex structure of the mhc class ii molecules localized at the posterior region of sperm head .
ligand association with the receptor typically involves changes in the intramolecular and intermolecular interactions and dynamics of the system components .
the changes in bonding interactions that occur upon ligand binding are reflected in the reaction enthalpy and entropy , which in turn determine the free energy of receptor - ligand association .
microcalorimetric instruments and methods are essential tools for the general understanding of binding thermodynamics of biological macromolecules and specific biological systems . in the present study , when microreaction calorimeter was used to determine the free energy ( g ) , enthalpy ( h ) , and entropy ( s ) of binding of sif with purified receptor it was observed that reaction was exothermic as heat was produced which indicated specific interaction between receptor and purified sif . from the above preliminary observations , it can be concluded that sif isolated from s. aureus could bind to spermatozoa and sperm surface protein might act as receptor for binding to sif .
the study also indicates that receptor - ligand interaction might be responsible for immobilization of spermatozoa by sif .
thus , the future studies of detailed molecular mechanisms of sperm immobilization by these receptor - ligand interactions could possibly lead to useful insights for improvements in the treatment of infertility , and in attempts to create safe as well as effective sperm immobilizing contraceptives ."	" sperm immobilization factor ( sif ) causing 100% immobilization of spermatozoa isolated from staphylococcus aureus when characterized using lc - ms ( liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry ) showed that this 20  kda protein had peptide sequence similarity with hsp-70 protein . 
 it was found to completely ( 100% ) inhibit mg++ atpase activity of spermatozoa at concentration of 100  g  ml1 . 
 sperm samples treated with sif also showed reduction in calcium ionophore - induced acrosome reaction as compared to control samples ( treated with calcium ionophore alone ) . 
 binding studies of fitc labelled sif with spermatozoa using fluorescent microscopy showed binding of sif to the surface of spermatozoa indicating the presence of sif binding receptor . 
 the receptor was extracted by 3 m nacl and purified by gel permeation chromatography . 
 characterization of the receptor by maldi - tof ( matrix - assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight ) indicated that the receptor shared sequence similarity with mhc class ii antigen . 
 a calorimetric study showed that the receptor moiety on spermatozoa was specific for the purified ligand as binding of the receptor to ligand was enthalpically ( 11.9  kj  mole1 ) as well as entropically ( 21.53  j  mole1  k1 ) favored resulting in the gibb 's free energy of 18.57  kj  mole1 .

30	"cellular senescence is a complex stress response that renders cells incapable of cell division , even in the presence of growth stimuli ( campisi , 2013 ) .
senescent cells are distinct from quiescent cells , which retain the ability to proliferate in response to appropriate stimuli .
senescent cells are also distinct from post - mitotic cells and terminally differentiated cells , which generally lose the ability to divide as a consequence of developmental , as opposed to stress - activated , programs . a senescence response is typically induced by cellular damage ( often nuclear dna damage or mitochondrial dysfunction ) ( von zglinicki et al . , 2005 ;
as part of the senescence response , senescent cells express a number of non exclusive markers , including the cell cycle inhibitor p16 and elevated levels of a lysosomal enzyme termed senescence associated  galactosidase ( sa gal ) ( rodier and campisi , 2011 ) .
many senescent cells also secrete several cytokines , growth factors , and matrix metalloproteinases , collectively termed the senescence associated secretory phenotype ( sasp ) ( coppe et al . , 2008 ) , which differ from those secreted by non senescent quiescent , post mitotic , and/or differentiated cells .
senescent cells can alter tissue homeostasis and promote age related diseases , including degenerative pathologies and cancers ( campisi , 2013 ; van deursen , 2014 ) .
the inability of senescent cells to proliferate can impair tissue regeneration after injury , causing prolonged or permanent tissue damage with age .
in addition , the sasp factors that are secreted by senescent cells can alter tissue microenvironments through their paracrine effects and promote age related phenotypes ( coppe et al . , 2008 ) .
indeed , removal of senescent cells in a premature aging mouse model reduced selected age related pathologies such as sarcopenia , cataracts , and loss of subdermal adipose tissue ( baker et al . , 2011 ) .
while cellular senescence is often viewed as a negative contributor to tissue function during the aging process , senescent cells , and particularly the sasp , can also have beneficial effects , such as the promotion of proper wound healing .
this aspect of senescent cells could explain why cellular senescence evolved and has been preserved during evolution , even though it contributes to age related phenotypes later in life .
here , we discuss how cellular senescence can be both beneficial and detrimental during skin aging and wound healing , and how the contrasting cell autonomous and non cell autonomous effects of senescent cells can depend on the physiological context . on the one hand ,
senescent cells can accelerate aging phenotypes through the loss of tissue homeostasis by promoting chronic inflammation , persistent degradation of the extracellular matrix , and stem cell exhaustion .
on the other hand , senescent cells can also play essential roles during wound healing by limiting excessive proliferation and fibrosis and promoting the formation of granulation tissue .
intrinsic aging , sometimes termed chronologic aging , refers mainly to sun protected areas of the skin .
intrinsic aging is associated with morphological changes primarily in the epidermal layer , manifest as marked thinning and loss of undulation ( flattening of the dermo epidermal junction ) ( makrantonaki and zouboulis , 2007 ) .
intrinsic aging also reduces subcutaneous fat and dermal thickness with an accompanying loss of cellularity and vascularity ( farage et al . ,
in contrast , extrinsic aging , particularly photoaging ( sun exposure ) , markedly affects both the epidermal and dermal layers , with the latter showing a striking loss of collagen and extracellular matrix ( quan et al . , 2004 ; quan et al . ,
mitchell , 1967 ) , which are due to formation of structurally different elastic fibers ( watson et al . , 2001 ) .
senescent cells increase with age in both the epidermis and dermis , as determined by elevated levels of sa gal activity and p16 expression ( dimri et al . , 1995 ; krishnamurthy et al . , 2004
; ressler et al . , 2006 ; waaijer et al . , 2012 ) .
because senescent cells can not proliferate , their presence in aged skin can potentially impair tissue homeostasis , regeneration , and youthful tissue structure / function ( campisi , 2013 ; signer and morrison , 2013 ) .
for example , in a three dimensional organotypic culture model using neonatal dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes from human donors of varying ages , increasing the expression of p16 in keratinocytes isolated from young ( 3040 years ) donors yielded a thin epidermal layer similar to that formed by keratinocytes from elderly ( 5366 years ) donors ; decreasing the expression of p16 in keratinocytes from elderly donors transformed the aged skin phenotype of a thin epidermal layer into a thicker epidermis , similar to that formed by keratinocytes from young donors ( adamus et al . , 2014 ) .
aside from the cell autonomous effects of non - proliferating senescent cells on skin homeostasis , sasp factors secreted by senescent cells are also thought to contribute to skin aging phenotypes in a cell non autonomous manner .
sasp factors , especially the matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) , become elevated with age and can alter the tissue microenvironment and accelerate skin aging phenotypes ( table 1 ) .
mmps can degrade collagens , including type i collagen , which is the most abundant protein in the dermal extracellular matrix ( ecm ) .
loss of collagen is associated with several clinical manifestations of aging skin , including wrinkles , sagging , and laxity ( jariashvili et al . , 2012 ; quan et al . , 2010 ; shuster et al .
, 1975 ) . hence , increased expression and activity of mmps during aging can decrease the amount of collagen in the skin ( varani et al . , 2004 ) , diminish fibroblast collagen interactions , and reduce mechanical tension , explaining the wrinkling phenotype observed in aged skin ( varani et al . ,
another hypothesis for facial wrinkling is the enhanced elastase activity upon uvb stimuli , which is associated with a reduction in the elastic properties of the skin ( imokawa , 2009 ) .
the role of cellular senescence in promoting changes in the elastic tissue has not been addressed yet , but represents an important avenue for future clinical approaches .
while it is still unclear which specific stimuli are responsible for inducing cellular senescence during aging , both intrinsic and extrinsic aging have been linked to the age related increase in the number of senescent cells in the skin .
for example , the hereditary disorders werner syndrome , xeroderma pigmentosum , and hutchinson  gilford progeria syndrome , which are due to defects in dna damage repair or nuclear organization , are associated with increased cellular senescence and accelerated age related phenotypes in the skin ( davis et al . , 2007 ; harada et al . , 1999 ; liu et al . ,
extrinsic factors , such as x - rays , ultraviolet ( uv ) light , and cigarette smoke , also can induce cellular senescence as well as age related phenotypes in the skin ( shin et al . , 2012 ; velarde et al .
uv light can induce photoaging via direct damage to ecm components , such as collagen and fibrillin fibers ( jariashvili et al .
indeed , mitochondrial dysfunction is suggested to play a role in both intrinsic and extrinsic aging , and may potentially serve as a common link between the two ( krutmann and schroeder , 2009 ) .
uv radiation induced photoaging of human skin is associated with large scale deletions in mitochondrial genomes ( mtdna ) ( berneburg et al . , 1997 ; birch machin et al . , 1998 ) .
intra individual studies have revealed that the frequency of a 4,977 bp deletion , also defined as 
, is increased up to 10 fold in photoaged skin compared with sun protected skin ( berneburg et al . , 1997 ) .
the majority of these deletions are detectable in the dermis of human skin exposed to physiological doses of uva ( berneburg et al . , 2005 ) .
uv radiation also induces this common deletion in cultured skin fibroblasts and decreases mitochondrial function ( berneburg et al . , 2005 ) . because mitochondrial damage and dysfunction induces cellular senescence in culture and in vivo ( passos et al . , 2006 ; velarde et al . ,
2012 ) , and uv light also promotes mitochondrial damage and cellular senescence , it would be interesting to test whether the uv - induced common deletion contributes to skin aging through mitochondrial dysfunction associated senescence .
this process is classically divided into four distinct but overlapping phases ( singer and clark , 1999 ) : 1 ) hemostasis , 2 ) inflammation , 3 ) proliferation , and 4 ) remodeling . during the first two phases , platelets promote coagulation and begin an inflammatory cascade by secreting a variety of cytokines and chemokines to attract macrophages and neutrophils ( fuhrman et al . , 1991 ; kim et al . , 2008 ; shallo et al . , 2003 ) . before the inflammatory phase ends ,
fibroblasts are recruited to the wound site and endothelial cells mature from progenitor cells to re establish vascularization ( chen et al . , 2008 ; postlethwaite et al .
the proliferative phase begins with the formation of a granulation tissue and collagen deposition , and the wound closes by epithelialization and the contraction of differentiated myofibroblasts , which are specialized contractile fibroblasts ( guo and dipietro , 2010 ) .
the final remodeling phase initiates when a stable ratio of collagen production and degradation is reached , and ends when the tissue acquires a mature organization and tensile strength after replacing transiently expressed collagen iii with collagen i ( madden and peacock , 1971 ; tomasek et al . , 2002 ) .
recent findings using mouse models show that senescent cells are transiently induced in the granulation tissue during the proliferative phase of wound healing and are efficiently removed during the transition to the remodeling phase ( demaria et al . , 2014 ) .
wound contraction is important for wound closure during the proliferative phase ( midwood et al . , 2004 ) and proceeds through the formation of newly synthesized granulation tissue and the activation of contraction in myofibroblasts ( tomasek et al . , 2002 ) .
thus , the presence of senescent cells within this window may be essential for proper wound healing .
indeed , the elimination of senescent cells in young mice bearing cutaneous wounds leads to poor formation of granulation tissue and a dramatic reduction in the number of myofibroblasts , with consequent delayed wound closure ( demaria et al . ,
notably , this phenotype can be rescued in senescence - free mice by topical application of the sasp factor platelet derived growth factor aa ( pdgf - aa ) , which promotes the differentiation and maturation of myofibroblasts .
senescence free wounds were also more fibrotic during the remodeling phase , but topical pdgf - aa was unable to limit this excessive fibrosis .
these findings illustrate the complex and diverse roles played by senescent cells during wound healing , and suggest that other sasp factors in addition to pdgf - aa are important for optimal wound healing .
as indicated above , another important contribution of senescent fibroblasts during tissue repair is to limit fibrosis , which is commonly observed in chronic wounds and is characterized by excessive collagen deposition ( telgenhoff and shroot , 2005 ) .
several mmps , including mmp2 , mmp3 and mmp9 , are part of the sasp ( table 1 ) ( coppe et al . , 2010 ; coppe et al . , 2008 ) and can degrade excess collagen and maintain tissue homeostasis during wound healing ( jun and lau , 2010 ) . indeed , failure to induce senescence during wound
healing causes fibrosis in the skin and liver ( jun and lau , 2010 ; kim et al .
overall , these results indicate that senescent cells can promote tissue repair through cell non autonomous mechanisms .
the irreversible growth arrest of senescent cells may restrict proliferation during wound healing as a means to protect against aberrant cell proliferation .
this cell autonomous effect of senescent cells is in keeping with a fundamental role for cellular senescence in tumor suppression ( campisi , 2001 ) .
cells from mice lacking the p16 and p21 genes are incapable of undergoing cellular senescence and highly susceptible to skin carcinogenesis upon dmba/ tpa treatment due to their inability to arrest cell proliferation ( takeuchi et al . , 2010 ) .
hence , the absence of cellular senescence may transform a wound into a hyperplastic or premalignant phenotype characterized by unregulated cell proliferation . because wound healing and cancer share several molecular and cellular events ( dvorak , 1986 ; feng et al . , 2010 )
, senescent cells may play an essential role in promoting wound healing while preventing cancer initiation . while a lack of senescent cells impairs wound healing and can promote tumorigenesis ,
for example , chronic wounds are characterized by the persistent presence of senescent cells in the wound areas ( mendez et al . , 1998 ; vande berg and robson , 2003 ; vande berg et al . , 2005 ) .
because chronic wounds fail to progress through the different stages of the wound healing process ( sen et al . , 2009 ) , an excessive number of senescent cells may restrict cell proliferation and disrupt paracrine signaling cascades , thereby retarding the ability of wounds to resolve after injury .
moreover , some of the sasp factors that are important for wound healing seem to also promote cancer progression through cell non autonomous mechanisms .
for example , certain mmps that are anti fibrotic in wounds can also promote tumor cell invasion during the progression of skin cancers ( woenne et al . , 2010 ) .
the complex role of senescent cells in the skin includes cell autonomous and non autonomous functions , which may be beneficial during wound healing but deleterious during aging ( figure 1 ) .
what determines the phenotype of senescent cells and whether their effects on the tissue microenvironment are positive or negative ?
one hypothesis is that both the cell autonomous and non autonomous properties of senescent cells are highly dependent on age and time .
first , the induction of an irreversible growth arrest might be an essential mechanism during wound healing that limits the number of highly proliferative cells , which are at risk for acquiring premalignant or malignant mutations .
however , with time and age , this mechanism can exhaust the pool of proliferation competent stem or progenitor cells , which contribute to tissue turnover and regeneration .
second , the slow accumulation of senescent cells in the skin due to increased number and/or defective clearance might create chronic inflammation and promote age associated skin pathologies , for example through the chronic production of mmps .
third , the sasp may be a malleable phenotype and change over time and with age .
thus , harmful cytokines , chemokines and other inflammatory factors may be secreted by senescent cells only when they are persistently present in the skin .
the elimination of senescent cells is an attractive avenue for developing new interventions to treat age - related pathologies , and several laboratories are searching for small molecules that might be of potential interest for future clinical studies ( see ( dorr et al . , 2013 ) for an example ) . in the skin , the different roles of senescent cells in promoting both physiological and pathophysiological conditions are still in early phases of discovery .
more experiments need to be done to determine how senescent cells can tip the balance between efficient and chronic wound healing .
it also remains to be proven whether presence of long - lived versus short - lived senescent cells plays a major contributory factor to this difference .
thus , whether and how an anti - senescence approach will help maintain healthy skin awaits future experimentation .
while the elimination of senescent cells might reduce age - related chronic inflammation and collagen degradation , this strategy could fail to restore youthful skin phenotypes that depend on adequate stem cell numbers .
finding ways to replenish these stem cells may be necessary in order to rescue age - related skin defects after the elimination of senescent cells .
furthermore , the continuous removal of senescent cells in the skin , particularly in the elderly , could impede wound healing and increase tissue scarring , which are of bigger concerns than having a youthful looking skin .
hence , a better understanding of the complexity of the cell autonomous and non - autonomous functions of senescent cells , and the mechanisms that lead to their induction , will be essential in order to develop specific therapeutic approaches with minimal side effects to treat age - related skin phenotypes and pathologies ."	" human and mouse skin accumulate senescent cells in both the epidermis and dermis during aging . when chronically present , senescent cells are thought to enhance the age - dependent deterioration of the skin during extrinsic and intrinsic aging . however , when transiently present , senescent cells promote optimal wound healing . here 
 , we review recent studies on how senescent cells and the senescence - associated secretory phenotype ( sasp ) contribute to different physiological and pathophysiological conditions in the skin with a focus on some of the cell autonomous and non - autonomous functions of senescent cells in the context of skin aging and wound healing .

Conclusion"
31	"uterine fibroids ( leiomyomata or myomas ) are benign tumours of smooth muscle cells and fibrous connective tissue that develop within the walls of the uterus .
they are the most common gynaecological problem experienced by women , being of clinical significance in 2040% of women of childbearing age .
the true prevalence of uterine fibroids is unknown because the majority of these tumours are asymptomatic .
traditionally , symptomatic fibroids have been treated with myomectomy or hysterectomy performed by laparotomy [ 1 , 2 ] .   over the last few years ,
undoubtedly the most significant therapeutic innovation has been the advent of uterine artery embolization ( uae ) as a form of nonsurgical management .
embolization is also an excellent option for patients who will not accept blood transfusions and for those who are severely anaemic and require immediate intervention [ 3 , 4 ] .
other absolute contraindications include comorbidities that may increase the risk for infectious complications ( e.g. , pelvic inflammatory disease or active genitourinary infection ) , the presence of an adnexal mass , and conditions that contraindicate any endovascular procedure ( e.g. , reduced immune status , severe coagulopathy , severe contrast medium allergy , or impaired renal function ) .
the desire to avoid a hysterectomy under any circumstances is also an absolute contraindication to uae .
there are no restrictions to the size and number of fibroids that can be treated with uae .
anatomic exclusion criteria only include submucosal fibroids that may be effectively treated with hysteroscopic resection and pedunculated subserosal fibroids with a narrow stalk because of the potential risk and complications from infarction of the stalk and subsequent fibroid detachment from the uterus .
the aim of our study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of uterine fibroid embolization in patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids .
all were consecutively selected from women presenting for evaluation for uterine artery embolisation at the department of obstetrics and gynecology of the university hospital split , croatia , between may 1999 and november 2006 . according to our existing protocol , patients were considered suitable for uae if they had single or multiple myomas causing symptoms ( namely , heavy menstrual bleeding and bulk related symptoms , which included pelvic pain and pressure effects ) sufficiently severe to warrant hysterectomy or myomectomy and wished to avoid surgery .
eligibility was not restricted by age , fibroid size , location , or previous surgery .
although women desiring children were not excluded from the study , they were further informed of the uncertain effects of uae on conception or carrying to full term .
exclusion criteria also included patients with pregnancy , active pelvic inflammatory disease , renal insufficiency , undiagnosed pelvic mass , or urogenital infection .
a detailed gynecologic history was obtained from each patient , followed by a detailed description of the procedure including a discussion of its potential risks .
this study was approved by the hospital ethic committee , with written informed consent obtained from each participant at the time of enrollment . during preprocedural testing , each patient underwent venous blood sampling ( complete blood count , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , prothrombin time ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the uterus .
all the patients were admitted to the department of gynecology the day before the procedure .
all procedures were performed by the same interventional radiologist according to the same procedure protocol . under local anesthesia , vascular access
was obtained with 5f catheter via the right femoral artery and aortic bifurcation to the contralateral internal iliac artery .
digital angiography was performed to identify the origin of the uterine artery , and thereafter , the left uterine artery was catheterized with coaxial 3f microcatheter .
the tip of the microcatheter was placed in the distal third of the left uterine artery , and 350500  m sized polyvinyl alcohol particles ( ivalon , nycomed , paris ) were injected until there was complete stasis of flow . after confirming the presence of a stagnant column of contrast in the left uterine artery , the right uterine artery was catheterized in similar fashion and embolized .
all catheters were removed and groin pressure was applied for 10 to 15 minutes , thus completing the procedure .
the goal of the therapy was to occlude the uterine artery branches that supply only the fibroid tumors and spare normal myometrial vessels.the arteriograms obtained after embolization revealed complete occlusion of the branches supplying the fibroids .
after the procedure , patients were kept in hospital for 2448 hours for further observation hematoma formation at the arterial puncture site and pain control .
all patients with successful procedures were evaluated at 3 , 6 , and 12 months after embolization with gynecologic examination , magnetic resonance imaging , and questionnaire .
they were asked whether their symptoms resolved completely , improved , remained unchanged , or deteriorated .
symptom change and patient satisfaction were classified as markedly improved , moderately improved , slightly improved , unchanged , and worse .   
descriptive statistics , including means and ranges , were calculated for dominant fibroid and uterine volumes , demographic and clinical characteristics .
differences in dominant fibroid and uterine volumes before and after uae were analyzed with student 's paired t - test .
there were 157 patients included in the study , but bilateral uae was successful in 152 ( 96.8% ) cases .
five ( 3.2% ) procedures were technically unsuccessful , four because of malformed vessels and one of them had allergic reaction to contrast medium .
all of the patients went home within the first week after the procedure ( range 16 days ) .
the majority of women went home the day after uae ( mean hospitalization was 1.4 days ) . 

table 2 summarizes complications of the embolization . after the procedure , most patients experienced crampy pelvic pain , of variable intensity , which was well managed with the standard analgesia protocol ( narcotics and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ) . some of the participants had nausea , and only few of them had vomiting .
all patients had an uneventful recovery and were able to return to normal activity within two weeks of embolization .
rate of uterine regression and dominant fibroid volume determined by magnetic resonance scanning 3 , 6 , and 12 months after procedure is shown in table 3 .
median uterine volume decreased by 38% , 57% , and 61% after 3 , 6 , and 12 months after embolotherapy , respectively .
comparison of the regression of preprocedural and final uterine volume revealed statistical significance ( p < 0.01 ) .
median dominant fibroid volume decreased by 46% , 61% , and 66% after 3 , 6 , and 12 months from preprocedure values , respectively .
the quantum regression of pretreatment to final dominant fibroid volume also revealed statistical significance ( p < 0.01 ) . 

all women reported resumption of regular menses except five ( 3% ) with persisting amenorrhea .    comparing uae and surgery
women stay in hospital for on average 6 days and then may take up to 3 months to recuperate . however , once the uterus is removed , there is no recurrence of fibroid - related symptoms .
uae is a minimally invasive technique with a short - term complication rate , and the great majority of women remain in hospital overnight to enable appropriate pain management [ 5 , 6 ] .
pain usually peaks on the first day following the procedure , but occasionally on the second day , and rarely on the third day postprocedure .
pain syndromes lasting longer than 2 weeks are rare . the pain is probably due to the ischemia produced by the embolization procedure .
strong analgesics and , particularly , patient controlled analgesia ( during hospitalization ) are extremely helpful during this period [ 38 ] .
we believe that an overnight admission is desirable , but others have advocated embolization on an outpatient basis [ 38 ] .
premature menopause has been documented in 1% to 2% of patients after uae and is believed to result from nontarget embolization of the ovaries via the collateral bed between the ovarian and the uterine arteries .
this is a risk that must be considered in a premenopausal woman who desires future fertility .
all authors who have published a series of any size have reported essentially similar outcome statistics [ 913 ] .   
in addition to two deaths from septic shock [ 14 , 15 ] , other three deaths following uae have thus far been reported , one from pulmonary embolism   and two from uncertain causes , in more than 100  000 procedures performed worldwide .
a relatively common complication of uae is vaginal expulsion of an infarcted fibroid , with a reported rate of up to 10% [ 9 , 13 , 17 ] .
this complication is more frequently seen in patients with submucosal fibroids or intramural fibroids with a submucosal component .
the infarcted fibroid is expelled spontaneously and no additional treatment is necessary [ 9 , 13 , 17 ] .  
eighty percent to 90% of patients embolized have reported significant improvements in menorrhagia , bulk - related symptoms , or both .
reduction in overall uterine volume averages 50% at 3 months after embolization and 67% at six months after embolization .
individual myomas showed average volume reductions at 60% to 65% , with a significant number of myomas becoming no longer visible at follow - up study [ 317 ] .
there have been no reports of reduced fertility after occlusion of the uterine vessels . at the same time
there are numerous reports of successful pregnancies after uae .   in conclusion , after tens of thousands of successfully performed uae worldwide
uae is a successful , minimal invasive treatment of myomas that preserves the uterus and requires shorter hospitalization and recovery times than surgery .
the complication rate is low , and the results are rapid and impressive . in the near future , embolization might replace conventional medical and surgical treatments of uterine fibroids .
the results of this study indicate that this procedure might be recommended as a primary treatment for young patients with fibroids who wish to preserve , or enhance , their fertility ."	" the purpose of this study was to evaluate safety , efficacy or complications of uterine artery embolization ( uae ) . 
 patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids ( n = 157 ) were treated by selective bilateral uae using 350500  m sized polyvinyl alcohol particles . 
 bilateral uae was successful in 152 ( 96.8% ) cases . 
 baseline measures of clinical symptoms and mri taken before the procedure were compared to those taken 3 , 6 , and 12 months after embolotherapy . also , complications and outcomes were analyzed after procedure . 
 all patients had an uneventful recovery and were able to return to normal activity within two weeks of embolization . 
 after the procedure , most patients experienced crampy pelvic pain , of variable intensity , which was well managed with the standard analgesia protocol . 
 five ( 3% ) of participants had persisting amenorrhea after procedure . 
 none reported any new gynecologic or medical problem during the follow - up period . 
 there were no deaths and no major permanent injuries . 
 reductions in mean uterine volume were 61% ( p < 0.01 ) and in dominant fibroid volume 66% ( p0.01 ) . 
 the follow - up showed significant improvement of bleeding . in conclusion , 
 uterine artery embolization is a successful , minimal invasive treatment of uterine fibroids that preserves the uterus , had minimal complications , and requires short hospitalization and recovery . "	"1. Introduction

32	"   in the   development of antibody - mediated therapies targeted to human cancer cells , including cancer stem / progenitor cells , the extracellular domains of plasma membrane proteins specifically expressed on cancer cells are promising candidates for antigens against which to be immunized , but the high homology of amino acid sequences between human antigens and their homologues in animals to be immunized often hamper efficient antibody production because of immunological tolerance . in the case of cellular membrane proteins having only a single transmembrane domain , recombinant protein with the extracellular domain fused to the ig - fc domain has been used as immunogen in many cases to generate antibodies reactive with the extracellular region .
however , in the case of plasma membrane proteins having multiple transmembrane domains , the three dimensional architecture of the protein outside the cell is expected to be composed of multiple extracellular domains , suggesting that construction of ig - fc fusion proteins for immunization would be difficult .    to obtain antibodies reactive to the native extracellular structure of such membrane proteins , immunization by injection of cultured cells expressing the antigen has been used . however , large numbers of cells ( typically 
				 10 - 10 
				  cells per animal ) are usually needed to prepare for immunization and some modifications of the injected cells are required , for example , genes encoding immunomodulatory cytokines ( interleukin-4 , and others ) or costimulatory molecules are expressed together with the antigen to obtain higher titers . moreover , the cells expressing plasma membrane proteins having multiple transmembrane domains such as g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) are not always available for immunization .
therefore , development of a simple and successful protocol for immunization against human multi - pass membrane proteins is needed in antibody - mediated cancer research .    
dendritic cells ( dcs ) are the most potent antigen presenting cells and robustly induce adaptive immunity mediated by t cells and b cells [ 4 , 5 ] .
the central role of dcs in immunity may explain why dc - mediated vaccines have been used for induction of cellular immunity against malignant tumor cells and infectious pathogens [ 68 ] .
the potency of dcs was demonstrated in previous studies to disrupt immunological tolerance against a tumor antigen and induce tumor antigen specific t cells .
the activation of cd4 t cells by dcs can exert helper functions to enhance efficient antibody production , production of high - affinity antibodies through somatic hypermutation , and class - switching of antibodies .
dcs can also release exosomes containing intact antigen , which induces activation of antigen specific b cells antibody responses .
these observations strongly suggest that targeted expression of antigens in dcs to stimulate production of useful antibodies is a reasonable experimental approach ; however , such attempts have been limited [ 9 , 12 ] .    in this study , we focused on an immunization method using dcs expressing human tumor transmembrane antigens .
dcs can efficiently present antigen to b cells and cd4   t cells because dcs express the antigen in intact form on the cell surface , to be recognized by antigen - reactive b cells , and in processed form in context with mhc molecules , to be specifically recognized by cd4 t cells .
the antigens used for immunization in this study were the human six transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 ( steap1 ) , human steap4 , and the human prostate specific g - protein coupled receptor ( psgr ) [ 1317 ] .
these antigens possess multiple transmembrane domains ( 6 in steaps and 7 in psgr ) and high degree of homology with the corresponding mouse proteins ( 82% in steaps and 92% in psgr amino acid identity between human and mouse ) .
the complex native extracellular structures and their high degree of homology imply that production of antibodies against such membrane proteins may be difficult .
however , in this study , we show that immunization using dcs efficiently induced antibody production against these membrane proteins in mice , which could be used for antibody - mediated immunological assays , including flow cytometry , immnuofluorescent staining , and western blotting .
   balb / c mice ( 68 weeks old ) were purchased from sankyo labo service co. ( tokyo , japan ) .
all animal experiments were performed according to the guidelines of the tokyo university of science .
293 t cells were maintained in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum ( fcs ) .
plate cells were cultured in dmem supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fcs , blasticidin ( 10 g / ml ) and puromycin ( 2 g / ml ) .
lncap and du145 human prostate cancer cell lines were purchased from riken bioresource center ( tsukuba , japan ) and cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fcs .
for androgen stimulation , 5--dihydrotestosterone ( 5-dht ) was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ( osaka , japan ) .
briefly , bone marrow cells from tibias and femurs of balb / c mice were isolated , and 2  10 cells were plated in 10 cm bacterial dishes ( iwaki , chiba , japan ) and cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fcs and 20 ng / ml recombinant murine gm - csf ( peprotech , rocky hill , nj ) for 10 days . the suspension and loosely - adherent cells were collected as cd11bcd11c bm - dcs .
pcaggs , and pcaggs - ha containing cdna encoding hemagglutinin ( ha ) of human influenza a virus ( h1n1/pr8 ) was kindly provided by dr .
the cdna encoding human steaps ( steap1 and steap4 ) and human psgr were cloned from human spleen cdnas ( clontech , palo alto , ca ) using pcr and from human prostate rna ( clontech ) using rt - pcr , respectively .
pcr products were inserted into pgem t - easy vector ( promega , madison , wi ) .
the sequences of these cdna fragments were confirmed using abi prism 3100-avant dna sequencer ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca ) . the cdnas were excised from pgem t - easy vector and inserted into either pmrx - ires - gfp or pcaggs .
the plasmids were propagated in e. coli ( dh5 ) and purified using a kit ( qiagen , valencia , ca ) for the following experimental procedures .  
plate cells in 10 cm dishes were transfected with pmrx - hsteap1 ( hsteap4 , hpsgr)-ires - gfp using fugene 6 ( roche , indianapolis , in ) .
the collected culture supernatants were added to bm - dc cultures on days 4 and   8 and incubated with 5 g / ml polybrene ( sigma , st .
the medium was replaced by fresh medium after the overnight incubation . on day 10 , bm - dcs were collected and analyzed using facscalibur ( becton dickinson , san jose , ca ) to confirm gfp expression in bm - dcs .
the percentage of gfp positive cells in bm - dcs was routinely 15% and the phenotype of the gfp positive bm - dcs was as same as non - infected bm - dcs .   
the bm - dcs ( 2  10 cells / mouse ) were injected via tail vein or directly into the spleen of mice ( 0 weeks ) . at 2 weeks , 4 weeks , and 6 weeks , gene transduction with plasmids expressing antigens ( pcaggs - hsteap1 , -hsteap4 , and -hpsgr ; 5 g of plasmids / mouse ) was performed as a booster immunization using hydrodynamic delivery via the tail vein .
the sera at 8 weeks after dc injection were tested in following immunological assays .   
293 t cells were transfected with pmrx - hsteap1-ires - gfp or pmrx - hsteap4-ires - gfp using lipofectamine ltx ( invitrogen , calsbad , ca ) . transfected 293 t cells , lncap cells , and du145 cells were detached from the dish by treatment with pbs/10 mm edta , collected , and resuspended in pbs/0.5% bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) . the immunized sera ( 1:100 diluted )
after washing , cells were incubated with pe conjugated goat antimouse igg ( beckman coulter , miami , fl ) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes .
after washing , stained cells were measured using facscalibur and data analysis was performed using the cellquest software ( becton dickinson ) . to determine igg1/2a ratio ,
the immunized sera are added to 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - ha , followed by incubation on ice for 30 minutes .
after washing , cells were incubated with pe conjugated goat antimouse igg1 or igg2a ( beckman coulter ) .
the mean fluorescence intensity of the stained cells was determined and igg1/2a ratio was calculated .   
the proteins in cell lysates were separated by sds - page and transferred to immobilon membranes ( millipore , bedford , ma ) . the block - ace ( snow brand milk products , tokyo , japan ) solution was used for blocking the membranes , and membranes were then reacted with 1:500 diluted anti - steap1 serum for 1 hour at room temperature .
after washing , the membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat antimouse igg+m ( biosource , camarillo , ca ) .
spleen and bone marrow cells removed from an immunized mouse were fused with sp2/0 myeloma cells using peg .
hybridoma cells producing anti - hsteap4 antibodies were cloned and established by limiting dilution and elisa screening .
the immunogloblin class of the antibodies produced from the hybridoma cells was determined using isostrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kit ( roche ) .   
lncap and transfected 293 t cells were seeded in eight - well chamber slides ( nalge - nunc , naperville , il ) . the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and , when required , permeabilized with 0.1% triton x-100 for 20 minutes at room temperature . after blocking , cells were incubated with 1:100 diluted serum or 4f2 ( anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody ) for 1 hour at room temperature .
after washing , cells were incubated with fitc conjugated goat antimouse igg ( jackson immunoresearch , west grove , pa ) for 1 hour at room temperature .
the stained cells were observed by confocal microscopy ( lsm510 , carl zeiss , jena , germany ) . in some cases ,
293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 were cultured in regular medium for 30 minutes in the presence of 4f2 . after culturing ,
medium was removed and the cells were washed by pbs , fixed and stained with fitc conjugated antimouse igg .
after 3 booster injections of pcaggs - hsteap1 , sera from immunized mice were subjected to flow cytometry analysis to check antibody production against native extracellular structure of hsteap1 .
the sera from two of the five immunized mice reacted with 293 t cells expressing hsteap1 in a flow cytometry analysis ( figure 1(a ) ) . as negative controls , we also immunized mice with dc not expressing hsteap1 with booster injections , or the hydrodynamic injections only ( n = 3 for each group ) .
no sera from these negative control groups stained 293 t cells expressing hsteap1 ( figure 1(a ) ) .
. moreover , immunized sera clearly reacted with hsteap1 protein ( 34 kd ) in western blotting , but negative control sera did not ( figure 1(b ) ) .
the previous studies [ 13 , 17 ] demonstrate that human prostate cancer cell lines including lncap and du145 express hsteap1 endogenously .
flow cytometry analysis showed that lncap cells were significantly stained with immunized serum , although du145 cells stained very faintly ( figure 1(c ) ) .
these results demonstrate that immunized sera could react with steap1 in human prostate cancer cells .
collectively , dc immunization can induce production of antibodies reactive to the native extracellular domain of hsteap1 .   
the frequency of antibody production against hsteap1 was relatively low ; therefore , we investigated better administration routes for dc immunization of mice .
we found that intrasplenic injection of dcs increased the frequency of antibody production relative to intravenous injections of dcs in ha and hsteap1 immunizations ( data not shown ) .
the immunized sera clearly reacted with 293 t cells expressing hsteap4 in flow cytometry ( figure 2(a ) ) .
in contrast , booster immunizations ( by the hydrodynamics method ) without dc injection of three mice resulted in no staining in sera from two mice and weak staining in serum from one mouse , suggesting that dc immunization is critical for efficient antibody generation against hsteap4 , as well as hsteap1 ( figure 2(a ) ) .
the anti - hsteap1 serum did not react with 293 t cells expressing hsteap4 , and vice versa , demonstrating that there was no significant cross - reactivity between the hsteap1 and hsteap4 antibodies ( figure 2(b ) ) .    
a previous study showed that hsteap4 was expressed in lncap cells and increased upon androgen stimulation of the cells .
the hsteap4 immunized sera stained a small proportion ( ~1% ) of lncap cells and staining in these cells increased following androgen ( 5-dht ) treatment of the cells ( figure 2(c ) ) .
the restricted expression of hsteap4 in lncap cells was also confirmed using immunoflorescent staining ( figure 2(d ) ) . as a negative control , serum from mice immunized with dcs expressing ha as an irrelevant antigen was used , and only background staining was detected .   
three igg monoclonal antibodies ( one was igg1 ,  and two were igg2a ,  ) against hsteap4 were generated from an immunized mouse . in immunofluorescent staining , hsteap4 proteins were clearly detected in 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 using these monoclonal antibodies as well as the immunized serum ( figure 2(e ) ) . in figure 2(e ) , 4f2 ( igg2a ) was used as representative .
the stained images demonstrated that hsteap4 was localized on the plasma membrane as well as intracellular structures , possibly endoplasmic reticulum , endosomes , and golgi apparatus , as described previously .
importantly , anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody ( 4f2 ) reacted with 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 even without cell permeabilization treatment .
the stained images showed extracellular domain of steap4 proteins on plasma membrane was recognized by anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody .
moreover , anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody ( 4f2 ) was added to 293 t cells transfected with pcaggs - hsteap4 followed by immunofluorescent staining .
figure 2(f ) showed that anti - steap4 monoclonal antibody bound hsteap4 proteins on cell surfaces , suggesting that monoclonal antibody recognized the native extracellular domains of hsteap4 .
these results collectively suggest that antibodies specific for hsteap4 can be efficiently generated using dc mediated immunization .
these results prompted us to investigate whether dc immunization with hydrodynamics booster injections is applicable to other plasma membrane proteins .
psgr belongs to the olfactory receptor family and is an orphan gpcr specifically expressed in prostate in both normal human tissues and prostate cancers .
we , thus , examined dc mediated antibody production against hpsgr . to test immunized serum for reactivity to native extracellular domains of hpsgr
, a flow cytometry analysis using lncap cells , which endogenously express psgr , was conducted .
the lncap cells were positively stained with sera collected from immunized mice ( figure 3(a ) ) .
hydrodynamic booster immunization alone failed to induce a significant antibody response against hpsgr in flow cytometry analysis ( data not shown ) . by immunofluorescent staining ,
psgr expression was specifically detected on the cell surface of lncap cells ( figure 3(b ) ) .
the cell surface specific staining even without cell permieabilization treatment ( figure 3(b ) ) suggested anti - psgr serum in dc immunization reacted with extracelluar domain of psgr as well as flow cytometry analysis . taken together , these observations indicate that dc immunization is effective in inducing antibody production against psgr , in addition to steap family proteins .    to further characterize the antibody response , we determined igg1/2a ratio of anti - ha antibody .
the anti - ha specific immunological response evoked by dc immunization was shown to be th2 dominant because the ratio of igg1/2a in dc immunization was 8.75 at average and anti - ha igg1 was more abundant than igg2a ( figure 4 ) .
the ratio of igg1/2a in dc immunization was higher than hydrodynamics method ( average of 4.17 ) , although the difference was not statistically significant .
   in this study , we investigated whether dcs as immunogens elicited antibody production against multiple - transmembrane proteins expressed in human prostate cancer cells .
previous studies demonstrated that immunization of mice with antigen - pulsed dcs resulted in efficient induction of antibody response .
accordingly , our results underline the utility of dc immunization in the induction of antibody response against the external domains of membrane tumor antigens that might be useful for development of antibody mediated treatment of cancer diseases .    
the priming immunization with dcs was very effective , whereas plasmid - based immunization using hydrodynamic delivery alone was not sufficient to stimulate antibody generation , although hydrodynamics was an efficient method for booster immunizations ( figures 1 and 2 ) .
moreover , dcs exerted superior activity in antibody production relative to balb / c 3t3 fibroblasts in ha immunization ( data not shown ) .
these observations suggest that dcs possess strong priming activity to induce antibody production . in general , dcs
are particularly known to induce th1 immune response because of their ability to initiate adaptive cellular immune response through production of high amounts of il-12 .
however , the high igg1/2a ratio obtained following dc immunization indicated their potential effect in stimulation of antibody production as well .
actually , because ha antigen is highly antigenic , hydrodynamic immunization significantly could induce anti - ha humoral responses , but igg1/2a ratio in dc immunization was higher than hydrodynamic immunization , suggesting that dc immunization can stimulate antibody response with th2 profile .
this strong immune response is particularly needed when using less immunogenic proteins such as steaps , which are highly homologous between human and mice .   
the steap family ( steap1 - 4 ) consists of a unique group of proteins : other proteins homologous to the steap family do not exist in higher mammals .
the steap family proteins share a high degree of homology in amino acid sequence , but there may be functional differences between steap1 and steap4 .
steap1 is largely lacking a cytoplasmic n - terminal tail homologous to bacterial and archaeal fno oxidoreductase , different from other steap proteins .
in fact , coexpression of steap1 and steap4 may occur in some human normal and malignant tissues .
an antibody - based analysis will be critical for understanding steap function and the dc immunization protocol used in this study can provide such antibodies .   
a flow cytometry analysis using anti - steap4 serum did not detect expression of steap4 in androgen independent du145 cells ( data not shown ) , which is consistent with previous results .
the monoclonal antibodies generated in this study were demonstrated to bind to the extracellular domains of hsteap4 , suggesting that these antibodies could be functional to promote or inhibit the functions of steap4 .
moreover , they could exert effector activities such as complement dependent cytotoxicity or antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity .
the monoclonal antibodies will be useful in these studies as well as in research on a role of steap4 in metabolic syndrome in mice and human .   
psgr expression is highly specific in normal prostate and prostate cancers , which makes it a very attractive target for antibody mediated therapy against prostate cancer .
dc immunization successfully induced antibody production against hpsgr , in this study . using dc immunization , a variety of antibodies reactive with gpcrs
the dc - mediated immunization protocol developed in this study is simple , and efficiently induced antibody production against the extracellular domains of several human multiple transmembrane proteins in mice .
the development of larger scale dc culture protocols , or more efficient gene delivery into dcs will be important to improve immunization results .
furthermore , genetic manipulation of dc to confer immunomodulatory functions may be critical , depending on the immune responses evoked by particular antigens .
we are further developing dc immunization protocols to generate monoclonal antibodies that specifically react with cancer stem cells , or highly metastatic cancer cells , which will be useful for novel anticancer therapeutic strategies ."	" antibody mediated therapeutic strategies against human malignant tumors have been widely authorized and clinically applied to cancer patients . in order to develop methods to generate antibodies reactive to the extracellular domains of multipass plasma membrane proteins specifically expressed in malignant tumors , we examined the use of dendritic cells ( dcs ) for immunization . 
 dcs were transduced with genes encoding the human six transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 ( steap1 ) , steap4 , and seven transmembrane prostate specific g - protein coupled receptor ( psgr ) . 
 mice were immunized with these dcs and followed by repeated booster immunization with plasmids expressing each protein . 
 the immunized mice produced significant amounts of antibodies against these proteins . 
 our results suggest that dc immunization is an effective method to produce antibodies reactive to extracellular regions of plasma membrane proteins with multiple - transmembrane domains , and may be useful to develop antibody mediated antitumor therapies . "	"1. Introduction

33	"ectopic mineralization of soft connective tissues , particularly the cardiovascular system , is globally a major cause of morbidity and early mortality ( budoff et al . , 2007 ) .
the pathomechanisms leading to deposition of mineral complexes in these tissues are exceedingly complex , but significant insights have been gained from observations in a group of heritable ectopic mineralization disorders with defined gene defects ( li and uitto , 2013 ) .
the prototype of such conditions is pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( pxe ) , a multi - system disorder characterized by deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite in various connective tissues , with protean manifestations ( neldner , 1988 ; uitto et al . , 2013 ) .
the classic form of pxe is of late - onset and slowly progressing , and the major clinical problems relate to loss of eyesight and development of vascular complications ( neldner , 1988 ) .
another , characteristically more severe ectopic mineralization disorder is the generalized arterial calcification of infancy ( gaci ) , frequently diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound revealing vascular calcium deposits ( nitschke and rutsch , 2012a ; rutsch et al . , 2011 ) .
the newborns manifest with cardiovascular complications and many of these patients die within the first year of life , particularly if not receiving bisphosphonate treatment ( see below ) .
finally , a more recently described condition , arterial calcification due to cd73 deficiency ( acdc ) , manifests with calcification of arterial blood vessels particularly in the lower extremities and in periarticular ligaments and tendons , typically encountered in older individuals ( markello et al .
thus , these clinical entities all manifest with varying degrees of mineralization of the arterial blood vessels , with evidence of phenotypic overlap ( le boulanger et al . , 2010 ; li et al .
significant progress has recently been made in understanding the genetic basis of these heritable ectopic mineralization disorders ( table 1 ) .
specifically , the classic form of pxe is now known to be caused by loss - of - function mutations in the abcc6 gene encoding atp - binding cassette subfamily c , member 6 ( abcc6 ) , a putative transmembrane efflux transporter protein expressed primarily in the baso - lateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes and in the proximal tubules of the kidney ( belinsky and kruh , 1999 ; pomozi et al . , 2014 ; scheffer et al . , 2002 ; uitto et al . ,
the molecules transported physiologically by abcc6 from the intracellular milieu to extracellular space have not been identified as yet , but recent studies have demonstrated that abcc6 is required for the release of atp from the hepatocytes raising the question whether atp , is the physiologic target molecule to be transported by abcc6 ( jansen et al . , 2014 ; jansen et al . , 2013 ) .
pxe is characterized by considerable both intra- and inter - familial heterogeneity , suggesting a role for genetic and environmental modifying factors .
researchers are now taking candidate gene and whole exome sequencing approaches to further dissect out the effects of putative modifier genes on clinical presentations in pxe ( dabisch - ruthe et al .
in addition , there are reports that alterations in lipid metabolism and soft tissue calcification are closely related pathologies , and in this context , the role of abcc6 deficiency has been studied in lipoprotein and cholesterol homeostasis and in the development of atherosclerosis ( kuzaj et al . , 2014 ;
several studies performed on pxe fibroblasts have demonstrated that mesenchymal cells , whether locally producing pro- and anti - calcifying factors or being involved in extracellular matrix synthesis and degradation , are involved in the mineralization of soft connective tissues ( boraldi et al . , 2014 ; ronchetti et al . , 2013
) . however , it is unclear at the present if all mesenchymal cells in pxe lesions behave similarly , or whether their tissue - specific differentiation contributes to different susceptibility of connective tissues to mineralization .
the classic form of gaci is caused by mutations in the enpp1 gene which encodes ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase / phosphodiesterase 1 ( enpp1 ) , an enzyme facilitating hydrolysis of atp to amp and inorganic pyrophosphate ( ppi ) ( fig .
1 ) . ppi is a powerful anti - mineralization factor , while inorganic phosphate ( pi ) serves as a pro - mineralization factor , and consequently , an appropriate ratio of ppi / pi is required to prevent spontaneous calcium phosphate precipitation under normal homeostasis . in the absence of enpp1 , this ratio is reduced and ectopic mineralization ensues .
interestingly , recent studies have demonstrated that some patients with pxe - like clinical features harbor mutations in the enpp1 gene while some patients clinically diagnosed as gaci have mutations in the abcc6 gene ( li et al .
therefore , these genotypic findings can explain the overlapping phenotypic features in some patients with ectopic mineralization disorders , pointing to shared pathomechanistic pathways leading to ectopic mineralization .
patients with acdc with vascular calcification have been shown to harbor mutations in the nt5e gene which encodes cd73 , a membrane - bound ecto-5-nucleotidase that breaks down amp to adenosine and pi ( markello et al . , 2011 ; st hilaire et al . ,
cd73 deficiency also increases the activity of tissue non - specific alkaline phosphatase ( tnap ) , accelerating conversion of ppi to pi .
adenosine is a physiologic inhibitor of tnap , and reduced adenosine concentration results in tnap activation further facilitating the conversion of ppi to pi ( fig .
in patients with pxe , the mutation database consists of ~300 distinct loss - of - function mutations in the abcc6 gene , including recurrent p.r1141x and g.del2329 mutations , which account for up to ~45% of all reported pathogenic alleles ( terry and hefferson , 2013 ) .
it should be noted , however , that most of the findings have been reported in caucasian patients from the united states and europe , and for example , only recently , mutations in pxe patients of asian ancestry have appeared in press .
specifically , a recent study on chinese patients with pxe revealed mostly previously unreported mutations , and there is an apparent paucity of the recurrent p.r1141x and g.del2329 mutations ( jin et al . , 2015 ) .
this observation emphasizes the importance of studying patients of various ethnic backgrounds and different ancestries to allow development of allele - specific therapies for pxe .
significant progress in understanding of the pathomechanistic details leading to ectopic mineralization in these disorders has been made by examination of animal models , particularly mice ( nitschke and rutsch , 2012b ) .
specifically , histopathologic examination of abcc6 knock - out mice ( abcc6 and abcc6 ) demonstrated the presence of mineral deposits in a number of tissues , including skin , eyes , and the cardiovascular system , similar to that in patients with pxe ( gorgels et al .
in addition to genetically engineered knock - out mice , a number of inbred mouse strains , such as kk / hlj , have been demonstrated to harbor a specific mutation in the abcc6 gene which predisposes these animals to ectopic mineralization similar to the corresponding targeted knock - out mice ( berndt et al . , 2013 ; li et al . , 2012a ) .
it should be noted that the degree of mineralization in these different mouse strains is highly variable even under standardized laboratory conditions , attesting to the presence of putative modifier genes ( li et al . , 2013a ) .
in addition to the mouse models , a rat model through inactivation of abcc6 gene using zinc finger nuclease technology has recently been developed .
preliminary data demonstrated mineralization of the dermal sheath of vibrissae of the homozygous mutant rat , similar to findings in abcc6 knock - out mice ( li et al . ,
unpublished ) . another animal model for pxe consists of a zebrafish which has an orthologous abcc6a gene .
knock - down of the abcc6a gene in 14 cell stage embryos by a morpholino , a stable antisense nucleotide eliciting suppression of expression of the targeted gene , results in profound phenotype consisting of pericardiac edema , stunted and curved tail ( li et al . , 2010 ) .
this phenotype can be readily rescued by concomitant injection of human or mouse abcc6 mrna together with the morpholino , attesting to the specificity of the abcc6a phenotype .
this model has provided a system to assess the pathogenicity of missense mutations in the human abcc6 gene by testing whether such mutant mrnas do or do not rescue the phenotype ( jin et al .
the missense mutation is deemed to be pathogenic , especially when combined with bioinformatics analysis .
in addition to the morpholino - mediated abcc6a knock - down system , a zebrafish grt mutant was recently identified in a forward genetic screen , with a p.l1429r mutation in the abcc6a gene ( mackay et al . , 2015 ) .
in contrast to morpholino - injected embryos with early lethality , the grt mutant fish survived for at least one year .
both heterozygous and homozygous mutant fish show signs of excessive mineralization in the craniofacial region and axial skeleton , and infrequently also in the skin .
in addition , abcc6a was found to be strongly expressed at the sites of mineralization rather than in the liver , as it is in human and mice .
therefore , the grt phenotype does not fully recapitulate that of humans with pxe due to bi - allelic mutations in the abcc6 gene .
a number of animal models , particularly targeted and spontaneous mutant mice , have also been identified and characterized to recapitulate the features of gaci caused by enpp1 mutations .
 tip toe walking ( enpp1/enpp1 ) was first described as a spontaneous mutant mouse harboring a p.g568x nonsense mutation in the enpp1 gene ( okawa et al . , 1998 ) .
these mice exhibit accelerated bone formation , ossification of the spinal ligaments and ectopic mineralization of the aortic medial layer at the level of the internal elastic lamina .
enpp1 knock - out mice exhibit abnormalities similar to those in  tip toe walking  mice ( sali et al . , 1999 ) . another enpp1 mutant mouse ( enpp1 ) , with a p.c397s missense mutation , has been characterized by low bone mineral density , crystal - related arthropathy and vascular calcification ( babij et al . , 2009 ) . a spontaneous mutant mouse with similar phenotype ( enpp1 )
these mice were shown to harbor a splice - site mutation c.259 + 1g > t in enpp1 gene ( takabayashi et al . , 2014 ) .
a mutant mouse with a missense mutation ( p.v246d ) in the enpp1 gene was recently identified at the jackson laboratory as a result of enu treatment ( li et al . , 2013b ) .
these mice demonstrated stiff posture , abnormalities in the front legs and stiffening of the joints ; hence , this mutation was named 
the lack of enpp1 enzymatic activity in asj homozygous mice results in reduced ppi levels in the plasma , accompanied by extensive mineralization of a number of tissues , including arterial blood vessels and the dermal sheath of vibrissae .
another mutant mouse , asj-2j , was also identified at the jackson laboratory with a phenotypic gait due to periarticular mineral deposits .
this mouse was noted by histology to have extensive mineralization of the dermal sheath of vibrissae as well as arterial blood vessels .
the asj-2j mice were shown to be allelic to asj mice by complementation studies , and these mice harbor of a large 40,035 bp deletion spanning from intron 1 to the 3-untranslated region of the enpp1 gene , coupled with a 74 bp insertion , thus completely eliminating functional gene in these mice ( li et al . , 2014a ) .
thus , these targeted and spontaneous mutant mice display features of gaci , and can serve as a platform to explore treatment of this ectopic mineralization disorder .
this mouse ( nt5e ) , developed by ablation of the nt5e gene ( castrop et al . , 2004 ) , showed stiffening of the joints , and micro ct revealed distinct changes in the thoracic skeletal structure with profound mineralization of the costochondral junctions ( li et al . , 2014b ) .
mineralization was also noted in juxta - articular joint - capsules as well as ligaments adjacent to the bony structures , features in patients with acdc .
no evidence of vascular mineralization was noted , indicating that the nt5e knock - out mice recapitulate some , but not all , features of acdc . there was a markedly reduced ppi / pi ratio in the plasma , attesting to the presence of a complex promineralization/ anti - mineralization network , characteristic to ectopic mineralization disorders , particularly in this case in acdc .
the metabolic hypothesis concerning pxe postulates that the absence of functional abcc6 activity , primarily in the liver , results in deficiency of circulating factor(s ) that are physiologically required to prevent aberrant mineralization under normal calcium and phosphate homeostatic conditions ( jiang and uitto , 2006 ) .
however , the physiological role of abcc6 protein is currently unknown , and in particular , the identity of the factor(s ) being transported in vivo has long remained a mystery .
recently , using cultured cells , abcc6 was found to mediate the cellular release of atp which is rapidly converted extracellularly into amp and ppi ( jansen et al . , 2014 ; jansen et al . , 2013 ) .
outside hepatocytes , but still within the liver vasculature , released atp is converted into amp and ppi , revealing an unanticipated role of the liver in systemic ppi homeostasis .
these findings raised the question whether atp is the physiologic substrate of abcc6 , however , transport of atp outside of the cells has not been demonstrated so far .
abcc6 , enpp1 , and nt5e , respectively , are all part of the pathway that involves generation of ppi and pi from atp ( fig .
1 ) . the unifying feature in these patients is reduction in the plasma ppi concentration resulting in reduced ppi / pi ratio .
since ppi is a powerful anti - mineralization factor and the primary deficiency in enpp1 or cd73 activity results in depletion of the ppi pool , it appears that these two conditions are pathomechanistically related .
furthermore , in the absence of functional abcc6 , the release of atp to the extracellular milieu is reduced , potentially lowering the extracellular pool of atp .
in such situation , less atp is available as a substrate for enpp1 , again resulting in reduced ppi plasma concentration ( fig .
1 ) . in support of this hypothesis are recent demonstrations that ppi levels in the plasma of patients with pxe are reduced leading to lower ppi / pi ratio ( jansen et al . , 2014 ; jansen et al . ,
thus , all three ectopic mineralization disorders , pxe , gaci and acdc , with overlapping phenotypic features , share the deficiency in the same metabolic pathway .
the phenotypic differences in these conditions may reflect the specific additional roles of the mutated genes when combined with modifying genetic factors and the environmental influences .
nevertheless , understanding the pathomechanistic alterations in these diseases may provide targets for pharmacologic modulation of the disease .
no specific treatment modality is currently available for prevention of systemic ectopic mineralization in pxe or gaci .
remarkable success has been achieved , however , in the treatment of ocular complications in pxe using vascular endothelial growth factor antagonists ( lucentis and avastin ) which prevent neovascularization and preserve the vision ( myung et al . , 2010 ; verbraak , 2010 ) .
in fact , this approach has markedly reduced the incidence of the most severe complication of pxe , i.e. , loss of vision , and has changed the focus of the disease to be largely on the skin and arterial vasculature . the first attempts to develop treatment for systemic mineralization in pxe focused on modifications of the mineral content of the diet .
preclinical animal studies , using abcc6 knock - out mice as a platform , demonstrated that a diet with elevated phosphorus and reduced magnesium content ( so - called  acceleration diet  ) enhanced the ectopic mineralization in this model , while conversely , increasing the magnesium content in the mouse diet by 5-fold completely abolished ectopic mineralization ( jiang and uitto , 2012 ; larusso et al . , 2009 ) .
furthermore , recent studies have demonstrated that feeding of pregnant mice with the  acceleration diet  increases the mineralization of the newborn pups , with apparent relevance to gaci characterized by ectopic mineralization of blood vessels during fetal development ( li et al . , 2015b ) .
based on the observations of the critical role of magnesium in modifying the degree of mineralization , a double - blinded placebo - controlled clinical trial with diet fortified with magnesium has been initiated in patients with pxe ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/nct01525875 ) .
considering the evidence in support of the notion that reduced ppi concentration is a critical factor allowing ectopic mineralization to ensue , a suggestion has been made that introduction of ppi would be helpful in prevention of the mineralization processes ( o'neill et al .
unfortunately , inorganic pyrophosphate is extremely labile and has a short half - life due to hydrolysis of the molecule .
this has raised the possibility to use stable , non - hydrolysable pyrophosphate analogs , bisphosphonates , for treatment of ectopic mineralization disorders .
in fact , bisphosphonates have been used for either prenatal or perinatal treatment of gaci patients , but careful examination of the literature reveals varying results , some studies showing apparent improvement , while in others very little , if any , effect is found ( edouard et al . , 2011 ; galletti et al . , 2011 ;
furthermore , bisphosphonate administration has resulted in severe toxicity after protracted therapy ( otero et al . ,
2013 ) . to explore the efficacy of bisphosphonates for treatment of ectopic mineralization disorders , recent studies have used abcc6 knock - out and asj mice as a model of pxe and gaci , respectively ( li et al .
in principle , bisphosphonates have two properties on mineralization : ( i ) anti - mineralization activity which is derived from incorporation of the bisphosphonate into calcium phosphate crystals preventing their growth , and ( ii ) anti - osteoclastic activity which prevents bone resorption .
the latter activity is the basis for extensive use of bisphosphonates for treatment of osteoporosis and other disorders affecting bone , including paget s disease , bone metastases , osteogenesis imperfecta and multiple myeloma ( uludag , 2002 ) .
bisphosphonates , etidronate or alendronate , demonstrated that they were able to prevent ectopic mineralization in abcc6 or asj mice when administered either by mouth at relatively high concentrations or by subcutaneous administration in 100-times lower concentration ( li et al .
interestingly , the microarchitecture of the bones , which is severely perturbed in the asj mice , was corrected with etidronate .
thus , there is a dual beneficial effect , i.e. , inhibition of soft tissue mineralization and improvement in bone microarchitecture , which was achieved by bisphosphonate administration .
it should be noted , that these beneficial effects were achieved with relatively high concentrations of bisphosphonates , and further long - term toxicity studies are required before this approach should be tested in clinical trials in humans , particularly concerning potential side effects .
the potential treatment of pxe has also recently been explored by a number of molecular and cell - based strategies .
for example , the potential correction of nonsense mutations in the abcc6 gene by read - through mechanism facilitated by ptc124 , a non - aminoglycoside nonsense mutation suppressor , has been tested ( zhou et al . , 2013 ) .
preliminary studies demonstrated that ptc124 enhances read - through of stop codon mutations in this gene in cell culture systems .
with respect to missense mutations with preserved transport activity but with improper plasma membrane localization of the protein , a chemical chaperone , 4-phenylbutyrate ( 4-pba ) , a drug approved for clinical use for other indications , has been tested in pxe mice .
the results revealed restoration of the plasma membrane localization of abcc6 in mouse hepatocytes in a limited number of specific mutations , suggesting that allele - specific therapy may be useful for selected patients with pxe and gaci , i.e. , those carrying missense mutations in their abcc6 gene ( le saux et al .
furthermore , transplantation of cells with hepatoblastic lineage differentiation , either representing a hepatoblast cell line or differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells ( ipscs ) , has demonstrated homing of these cells to the liver and has resulted in abcc6 protein expression in abcc6 knock - out mice ( jiang et al .
significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular basis and pathomechanistic pathways involved in heritable ectopic mineralization disorders , as exemplified by pxe , gaci and acdc .
this progress has now identified pathways that can potentially serve as pharmacologic targets towards treatment of these currently intractable disorders .
while these heritable disorders are rare , study of these conditions has allowed significant insights into complex , much more common disorders .
for example , utilization of mouse models of pxe , the level of hepatic expression of abcc6 has been shown to determine the severity of calcification and the infarct size after cardiac injury , contribute to arterial calcification , and participate in development of chronic kidney disease ( brampton et al . , 2014 ;
lau et al . , 2014 ; mungrue et al . , 2011 ; prunier et al
in that sense , the abcc6 transporter system can be considered as a paradigm for extending the knowledge from rare heritable diseases to complex disorders ( de vilder et al . , 2015 ) . finally ,
development of novel pharmacologic interventions for rare heritable ectopic mineralization disorders , such as pxe , may be applicable to disorders , such as arteriosclerosis , a much more common condition in general populations , with a major burden to the global healthcare systems ."	" heritable ectopic mineralization disorders represent a phenotypically diverse group of conditions characterized by deposition of calcium phosphate complexes in soft connective tissues . 
 the prototype of such conditions is pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( pxe ) , and related conditions with overlapping clinical features include generalized arterial calcification of infancy ( gaci ) and arterial calcification due to cd73 deficiency ( acdc ) . 
 molecular genetic investigations have revealed mutations in the genes physiologically involved in generation of inorganic pyrophosphate ( ppi ) and phosphate ( pi ) , and the findings suggest a unifying pathomechanism relating to reduced ppi / pi ratio . 
 this hypothesis is based on the notion that ppi serves as a powerful inhibitor of mineralization while pi is a pro - mineralization factor , and an appropriate ppi / pi ratio is critical for prevention of ectopic mineralization under homeostatic conditions.pxe international , the premiere patient support organization , advocating on behalf of patients and families with pxe , sponsors regular research meetings evaluating the progress in this and related ectopic mineralization disorders . the latest meetings were held in september 2014 in bethesda , md and in september 2015 in budapest , hungary . 
 this report summarizes the latest progress in research on pxe and related ectopic mineralization disorders , based on presentations and discussions in these meetings , with pharmacologic implications for currently intractable disorders . "	"Introduction

Conclusions"
34	"despite decades of intensive research , cancer remains one of the most dangerous diseases in the developed world . in the united states alone ,
the incidence of various tumors and cancers is increasing at an alarming rate despite great achievements and decades of intensive , labor - consuming and expensive research . according to the national cancer institute estimates , slightly less than one - in - two men and a little more than one - in - three women in the u.s .
although some success in surgical removal of primary tumors has been achieved , it is difficult to terminate the spread of metastatic cancer or to predict which early stage cancers are potentially metastatic .
therefore , there has been an intense interest in methods for identifying patients with higher recurrence risk . among the many ,
procathepsin d ( pcd ) is one of the independent prognostic factors that has gained considerable attention in recent years[18 ] .
the first study showing increased levels of cathepsin d ( cd ; processed form of pcd ) in several human neoplastic tissues was reported in the mid - eighties .
subsequent clinical studies demonstrated a correlation between pcd / cd levels and tumor size , tumor grade , tumor aggressiveness , incidence of metastasis , prognosis and a degree of chemoresistance in a variety of solid tumors[1214 ] .
various studies employing several different approaches such as immunohistochemistry , in situ hybridization , cytosolic assay , northern and western blot analyses indicated that in most breast cancer tumors , pcd was overexpressed at least 2-to-50 fold .
the mitogenic effect of secreted pcd on breast cancer cells was first demonstrated by vignon et al .. subsequent additional studies showed that secreted pcd functioned as an autocrine growth factor in breast , prostrate , ovarian and lung cancer cells .
in contrast , decreased expression of pcd by antisense gene transfer , rna interference or ribozymesresulted in decreased growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo .
consistent with this , tumor growth was also inhibited by utilization of anti - pcd antibodies in vivo and in vitro .
in addition to this autocrine mitogenic effect , pcd is also implicated in paracrine communication with surrounding cells .
berchem 's group demonstrated that pcd not only stimulated parent cancer cell proliferation but also tumor angiogenesis by a paracrine mechanism .
. showed that pcd secreted from cancer cells possibly stimulated proliferation , survival , motility and invasive potential of surrounding fibroblasts by activation of the ras - mapk pathway indicating pcd 's role in paracrine communication . supporting these data
, we demonstrated substantial secretion of cytokines especially il-4 , il-8 , il-10 , il-13 and mip-1b from both cancer cell lines and fibroblasts after addition of pcd which promoted the growth of both cell types .
direct association of secreted pcd with cancer invasion and metastasis has also been demonstrated by independent studies .
the first direct role of pcd in cancer metastasis was demonstrated in rat tumor cells where over - expressed pcd increased the metastatic potential of these cells .
alternatively , downregulation of pcd expression by antisense gene inhibited lung metastasis of breast cancer cells but had no effect on invasion in vitro .
however , tedone et al . showed that downregulation of pcd expression resulted in decreased invasion of mcf-7 cells in vitro .
in addition , sivaparvathi et al . observed that anti - cd antibodies inhibited glioblastoma cell invasion through matrigel .
consistent with this data , our studies with decreased pcd secretion from breast and lung cancer cells directly influenced their ability to cross the matrigel membrane in vitro and in vivo .
berchem et al demonstrated that secreted pcd stimulated tumor angiogenesis in tumor xenograft in athymice nude mice . supporting this , we recently observed several regulators of angiogenesis being differentially expressed in breast cancer cells treated with the activation peptide of pcd .
these studies strongly suggest that pcd may also be involved in angiogenesis during cancer progression . since the control of angiogenesis is a balance between positive and negative angiogenic factors , additional experiments are required to define the exact role of pcd in angiogenesis . supporting the diverse functions of pcd in cancer progression , microarray analysis of activation peptide ( ap ) treated breast cancer cells showed differential expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression , cell survival , cell adhesion , angiogenesis , invasion and metastasis .
in contrast , decreased expression of these genes in response to ablated pcd using rna interference further confirmed the role of pcd in cancer progression . despite extensive documentation regarding pcd 's role in cancer progression ,
independent studies have shown that the secreted pcd binds to the surface of the breast cancer cells through a receptor with possible downstream signalling . based on these observations , we proposed a model for the mechanism of pcd action in which overexpressed pcd escapes its normal targeting pathway and is secreted from the cancer cells .
the secreted pcd interacts via its activation peptide to an unidentified cell surface receptor present on its surrounding cells .
this interaction releases a signal resulting in differential expression of cancer promoting genes that includes various cytokines that stimulate tumor growth .
collectively , these studies not only define pcd as a tumor marker of cancer progression but also underlie pcd as a potential target for cancer therapy if selective inhibition of pcd interaction with a cellular receptor could be achieved .
current diagnostic assays for cancers are antigen - based and rely on the detection of circulating proteins that are associated within a particular cancer . these assays are based on the expression , synthesis and release of specific proteins by tumor cells either by active secretion or shedding or as a consequence of cell death ( either by necrosis , apoptosis , or autophagy ) .
regardless , these antigenic proteins must  escape  the primary site of disease , saturate the antigen - processing capacity of the individual 's immune components , gain access to the circulation , and reach a sufficient steady - state concentration to be detected by enzyme- or radiolabel - based immunoassays .
thus , despite the fact that certain specific antigenic epitopes exhibit common recognition sites among patients with the same tumor types , the use of these antigen - based cancer assays has not been widely accepted into clinical practice and many individual countries differ in the use of these potential diagnostic factors .
research performed in both our laboratory and others has demonstrated the presence of anti - pcd autoantibodies .
as these antibodies are specific to pcd only and do not recognize mature cd , they represent an ideal target for comparison of the pcd presence and cancer progression .
as pcd / cd is supposed to be contained inside the cells , it is possible that the body will react to their presence by formation of specific autoantibodies .
subsequently , their level might correlate with the stage of breast , lung and prostate cancer , corresponding with the increased number of pcd - releasing cancer cells and thus offer a cost - effective , non - invasive screening test . as the release of pcd was observed in numerous cancer types[1521 ] , one can assume that the specific autoantibodies will also be formed in additional types of cancer . in our preliminary experiments
, we found the elevated levels of anti - pcd autoantibodies in lung , prostate and stomach cancer .
we assume that the amount of the appcd / pcd in the patient 's serum will change with the progress of the cancer disease , in correlation with the increased number of pcd - releasing cancer cells .
since the levels of autoantibodies corresponded with stages of breast cancer , it is clear that there is a high clinical potential in evaluation of specific anti - pcd autoantibodies as biological marker .
in past decades , more and more interest was focused on the possible additional roles of pcd 's .
independent studies showed the potential role of pcd in wound healing , tissue remodeling and programmed cell death - apoptosis .
epidermis is the barrier between the body and external environment which is constantly exposed to various forms of environmental and physical stresses .
keratinocytes are the basic elemental cells that form the epidermis and play a critical role in normal regeneration and healing processes .
skin healing is dependent upon several processes that involve inflammation , protein synthesis , matrix deposition , migration and subsequent proliferation of keratinocytes .
numerous proteins that include proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases , interstitial collagenase and cathepsin b are secreted from keratinocytes . during the wound healing process
, these proteolytic enzymes may play a role in motility of keratinocytes by remodeling of extracellular matrix for migration of keratinocytes to peripheral layers of epidermis .
indeed , the study conducted by katz and taichmann , focusing on the proteins secreted by cultured human epidermal keratinocytes , showed cd being one of the secreted proteins . in skin , increased levels of the mature form of cd was shown in basal keratinocytes during hyperproliferative skin disorders such as psoriasis .
in addition , the involvement of different isoforms of cd in the epidermal cell differentiation was suggested .
the presence of pcd was shown in the spinous layer and the active forms were present in stratum corneum , where they played a role in epidermal desquamation .
although the role of cd in epidermal differentiation has been defined , the presence of pcd at different stages of differentiation is still unclear .
moreover , most of these studies were performed using cell lysates where all the isoforms are present , thus making clear distinction of the roles played by individual isoforms virtually impossible . to better define the role of pcd in differentiation , our recent study demonstrated active secretion of pcd by human keratinocytes cell line hacat .
subsequent experiments showed that exogenous addition of purified pcd enhanced the proliferation of hacat cells .
this proliferative effect of pcd was inhibited by monoclonal antibody against the activation peptide of pcd . supporting this , treatment of hacat cells with pcd or
its activation peptide resulted in the secretion of a set of cytokines that promoted the growth of cells in a paracrine manner .
the role of secreted pcd and its mechanism of action were further studied in a scratch wound model . while the presence of pcd and its activation peptide enhanced the regeneration of monolayer , this effect was reversed by the addition of anti - ap antibody .
finally , expression and secretion of pcd was upregulated in hacat cells exposed to various stress conditions .
taken together , our results strongly suggest that the secretion of pcd is not only linked to cancer cells but also plays an essential role in the normal physiological conditions such as wound healing and tissue remodeling .
while many functions of pcd in the physiological and pathological processes could be attributed to its enzymatic activity , this review clearly establishes that some of the functions of pcd are independent of its protease activity and rely on the ability of pcd to interact with other important molecules .
therefore , it seems inevitable that searching for pcd - interacting partners should be conducted to explore the mechanism of pcd actions ."	" procathepsin d is a major glycoprotein that is secreted from numerous types of cancer cells including breast , lung and prostrate carcinomas . 
 it affects multiple stages of tumorigenesis that include proliferation , invasion , metastasis and apoptosis . 
 previous studies showed that the mitogenic effect of procathepsin d on cancer cells was mediated through its propeptide or activation peptide . 
 recent studies have also implicated the possible use of procathepsin d / activation peptide as a marker of cancer progression . 
 considering the broad range of functions of procathepsin d , the present review summarizes the three major potentials of procathepsin d - cancer progression , tumor marker and wound healing . "	"Procathepsin D in Cancer Progression

Conclusion"
35	"many recent microbial analyses in rice fields have , therefore , focused on anaerobic microorganisms such as fermentative , acidogenic , and methanogenic microorganisms that are directly or indirectly involved in methane production .
rice fields are usually flooded during the cropping season and drained after harvesting , and therefore , rice soils cycle through aerobic and anaerobic conditions throughout the year . during the drainage period ,
the major final decomposers of organic matter are aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria and filamentous fungi . of these
, many filamentous fungi are well known to secrete hydrolytic enzymes involved in biopolymer degradation , and therefore , they are considered to play significant roles in the decomposition of organic matter , especially in woods and upland soils .
filamentous fungi may also serve as decomposers of organic matter , such as plant debris and plant root exudation during the drainage period , in rice field soils .
kimura and asakawa   showed the predominance of fungi in the microbial community of rice straw in a drained rice field using phospholipid fatty acids ( pflps ) as biomarkers .
hatamoto et al .   indicated by pcr - dgge analysis that eukaryotes including fungi were associated with the decomposition of rice straw compost incorporated into rice soil especially at the midseason drainage .
many saprobic fungi have been isolated from ukrainian rice soil before submerging and after draining .
however little is known about the ecological roles of such filamentous fungi during the water - logged phase because fungal species capable of anaerobic growth has not ever been isolated from rice soils .
although most filamentous fungi are obligate aerobes , some obligate anaerobic species , collectively called rumen fungi and classified as chytridiomycota , do exist in spite of the fact that their habitat is limited to the gastrointestinal tract of herbivorous mammals .
tabak and cooke   reported anaerobiosis of 13 fungal strains isolated from oxygen - limited environments , such as sewage sludges , polluted waters , and organically enriched soils .
previously , wada   reported that an unidentified spore - forming filamentous fungus colonized rice straws in submerged rice field soil where the anaerobic condition was sufficient for sulfate reducing .
saito et al .   showed that cellulose filter papers or cellophane films incorporated into submerged rice field soil were transiently colonized by fungal hyphae ten days after flooding .
recently , it has been suggested that fusarium oxysporum likely acquires energy for growth by denitrification   and by ammonia fermentation .
fungal denitrification occurs in an o2 limited environment in which n2o is generated as a final denitrified product because of the lack of n2o reductase to generate n2 from n2o . on the other hand ,
fungal ammonia fermentation occurs in an anaerobic environment in which no3 is reduced to nh4 and ethanol is oxidized to acetate .
the fungal denitrification and ammonia fermentation in response to hypoxic conditions are considered to extensively distribute among many fungi .
these findings show the possibility that filamentous fungi capable of growth in the absence of oxygen are likely distributed in anaerobic environments in greater numbers than expected .
the author , therefore , attempted to isolate anaerobic filamentous fungi living in rice soils by applying the method of hungate 's roll - tube anaerobic technique   generally used in colonization of anaerobic prokaryotic cells . here , the author reports the isolation and characterization of a novel facultative anaerobic fungus from japanese rice field soil .

 thermomyces lanuginosus nbrc 9738 purchased from the national institute of technology and evaluation was used for comparison with rb-1 .
martin 's medium   reduced with 0.03% cysteine hydrochloride was used for anaerobic fungal isolation from rice field soil . for usual cultivation , basal medium
( 0.1% kh2po4 , 0.05% mgso4 7h2o , 0.5% peptone , 0.1% yeast extract , and 1% glucose , ( ph 7.0 ) ) was used . for testing utilization of substrates , 1% glucose in the basal medium
was substituted by the indicated substrates . for examining cultural and morphological characteristics , potato dextrose agar ( pda : nissui ) was used . for anaerobic cultivation , media containing 0.0001% resazurine were prepared under an oxygen - free n2 atmosphere for visual check of reducing conditions . before inoculation , the media were reduced by aseptically adding cysteine hydrochloride ( adjusted to ph 7.0 ) to a final concentration of 0.03% .
the tubes , vessels , and flasks used were closed with cotton plugs for aerobic cultivation and butyl rubber stoppers for anaerobic cultivation .
if needed , suitable amounts of caco3 were added to the medium as a ph stabilizer to maintain the culture ph at 5.65.8 .
isolation of the fungus used in this study was essentially carried out in accordance with the hungate roll tube technique . all procedures except soil sampling and aerobic incubation on pda during the final step of isolation
soil was collected from 010  cm depth from the rice field at kanagi farm of the teaching and research center for biocoexistence at hirosaki university , aomori , japan , in april 2004 .
some of the soil properties were as follows : ph ( h2o ) , 6.0 ; water content , 38.9% .
the soil sample was serially diluted in a 0.03% cysteine hydrochloride solution ( ph 7.0 ) and transferred to agar - solidified medium ( reduced with 0.03% cysteine hydrochloride ) role tubes , which were then incubated at 25c in a vertical position .
after two months of incubation , the mycelium of a fungal colony formed on the agar was transferred to the same anaerobic fresh slant medium and incubated at 25c .
after two repetitions of the procedure , the mycelium developed on the anaerobic slant was transferred to a pda plate and aerobically incubated at 25c . a single spore isolate from the pda plate culture
the cultures of rb-1 were maintained on pda slants prepared in 25  ml tubes under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .
the rb-1 strain has been deposited in the japan collection of microorganisms ( jcm ) as jcm13780 . for morphological observations and determination of cultural characteristics ,
the isolate was cultured aerobically or anaerobically on pda plates at 25c or on pda thinly spread on a glass slide at 25c ( slide culture ) .
anaeropack ( mitsubishi gas chemicals co. , inc . ) was used for generating anaerobic atmosphere . after staining with lactophenol cotton blue ,
the morphology of the isolate was observed under differential interference contrast with the use of an olympus microscope ( bx50f4 ) or under phase contrast with an olympus microscope ( mx50 ) . for macroscopic observations , a stereomicroscope ( olympus szh10 )
nearly full - length small subunit ( ssu ) rdna ( 1,760  bp ) was pcr - amplified using the primer pair e21f ( 5-atctggttgatcctgccagt-3 ) and e1778r ( 5-aatgatccttccgcaggttc-3 ) .
for amplification of the internal transcribed spacer ( its ) region and the 5 end of large subunit ( lsu ) rdna including the d1-d2 domains ( its - lsu rdna ) ( 1,259  bp ) , a primer set its5 ( 5-ggaagtaaaagtcgtaacaagg-3 )   and nl4 ( 5-ggtccgtgtttcaagacgg-3 )   was used .
the pcr products were directly sequenced using the thermo sequenase cy5.5 dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and the seq 4.4 personal sequencing system ( amersham ) .
the sequences of ssu rdna and its - lsu rdna of the isolate are deposited in the ddbj / genbank / embl databases under the accession numbers ab246879 and ab517730 , respectively .
the determined sequences and those of relatively closely related taxa to the isolate retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases by searching with blast program were aligned using the clustal w program .
the evolutionary distances between the sequences were calculated using kimura 's two - parameter model , and the phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor - joining method   using the mega 4.0   computer program .
bootstrap analyses were conducted to assess the confidence limits of the branching by 1000 heuristic replicates .
the temperature and ph profiles of the isolate were determined by measuring the diameters of the colonies developed under aerobic conditions .
the ph profile was tested on the basal medium plate at a ph range from 2.0 to 9.5 .
for testing available substrates for fermentation , autoclaved or filter - sterilized substrates were added to 10  ml of basal medium instead of glucose in culture tubes , and the mycelium from the pda slant was inoculated into the medium .
incubations were carried out at 30c for up to 3 months under aerobic or anaerobic conditions without shaking .
time course of growth by the isolate under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was determined using 500  ml erlenmeyer flasks with 100  ml of basal medium inoculated with the equivalent of 1.5  mg ( dry weight ) mycelium previously grown aerobically in 10  ml basal medium at 30c for 10 days .
after inoculation , the flasks were incubated at 30c in a reciprocal shaker operating at 100  rpm .
samples were collected at various intervals by filtration through nitrocellulose filters and were measured after drying to a constant weight at 105c ; the resulting filtrates were used to determine the residual glucose and fermentation products .
growth yields of the isolate on aerobic and anaerobic medium were determined using 125  ml serum bottles with 100  ml of basal medium inoculated with a trace amount ( < 0.1  mg ) of mycelium from the pda slant picked with a needle tip . after static incubation at 30c for 10 days , cultures underwent the same analytical procedures for growth analysis as described above .
growth ability of the isolate under anaerobic conditions was confirmed by a successive transfer experiment as described by gleason and gordon .
the mycelium of the isolate grown on the pda slant was inoculated into 100  ml anaerobic basal medium prepared in a 125  ml serum bottle .
the culture bottle was incubated at 30c and a small part of the mycelium grown in the medium was transferred every five days into the same medium .
exposure of mycelium to an atmospheric condition was avoided as possible with an immediate transfer to the next fresh medium .
ethanol was analyzed in a gas chromatograph ( shimadzu gc8a ) equipped with an fid detector and a porapaq n column ( waters ) .
organic acids were measured by using hplc ( organic acid analysis system , shimadzu ) equipped with an ion exclusion column ( shim - pack scr-101h ) and detected by a post - column ph - buffered electroconductivity detection method   according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
gas samples were determined by gas chromatography ( shimadzu gc8a ) equipped with a tcd detector and a wg-100 column ( gl sciences ) .
the strain designated rb-1 was a filamentous fungus isolated from japanese rice field soil that could grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions .
after six weeks of aerobic incubation at 25c on a pda plate , the colonies were olive to olive - green in color , with a floccose texture , and few aerial mycelia .
the color of the colonies was white initially and then turned from light green to dark green and eventually from olive to olive - green .
exudates and soluble pigment were not produced . in the vegetative stage , septate hyphae , which were 2.03.0  m in diameter , changed in color from hyaline to bright brown with aging and
the morphological features of rb-1 after two months of aerobic incubation are shown in figures 1(a)1(e ) .
. single or occasionally chained aleurioconidia , which were hyaline when young and brown to dark brown when mature , were borne on the tips of the slightly swollen conidiogenous cells or directly on the sides of the vegetative hyphae ( figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) ) .
mature conidia were globose - shaped or sometimes slightly subglobose - shaped single cells , 7.511.3  m in diameter , and their surfaces were verrucose or punctuate ( figure 1(c ) ) .
chlamydospores , which were smooth or verrucose , globose to oval , light brown to dark brown , and 9.011.0  m in diameter , occurred frequently in the vegetative hyphae ( figure 1(d ) ) .
, primordium - like structures constructed with subglobose and globose cells were formed after two months of incubation ( figure 1(e ) ) .
colonies on the anaerobic pda plate were always white , and aerial mycelia were rarely observed , at least during the incubation period ( up to 3 months ) . in the presence of caco3 , colonies on the anaerobic pda plate developed at a rate similar to that under aerobic conditions with dissolving insoluble particles of caco3 .
however , in the absence of caco3 , colony development was slower than that under aerobic conditions and ceased when the colonies reached approximately 60  mm in diameter , which indicates that the lowered ph caused by acid production inhibited colony development .
although normal conidium development did not occur under any anaerobic conditions , some swollen cells looking little similar to conidium and chlamydospore structures were observed after three months of incubation ( figure 1(f ) ) . 

thermomyces lanuginosus , a fungal species apparently related morphologically to rb-1 , did not grow under any anaerobic conditions .
moreover , acid production in its aerobic cultures was not observed different from those of rb-1 .
the ssu rdna sequence of rb-1 showed less than 96% similarity with those of other known fungal species and was most closely related to bellemerea alpina ( 95.3% identity ) , which belongs to the order lecanorales of the class lecanoromycetes . a phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of ssu rdna retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases
totals of 30 taxa ( 1,659 to 1,669  bp after alignment ) were used . in this tree
t. lanuginosus showed a relatively low ssu rdna sequence similarity ( 92.0% identity ) with rb-1 and the presence in the class eurotiomycetes ( figure 2 ) . in order to gain further insight into the classification of rb-1
a ddbj / genbank / embl search revealed that the d1-d2 sequence of rb-1 had low similarity with those of related fungal species ( less than 89% identity ) .
the d1-d2 sequence of caloplaca regalis , which is classified as teloschistales of the class lecanoromycetes , showed the highest similarity ( 88.6% identity ) with that of rb-1 .
a phylogenetic tree constructed based on the d1-d2 sequences , which were retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases , is shown in figure 3 .
totals of 29 taxa ( 496 to 500  bp after alignment ) were used to construct a phylogenetic tree . in this tree , rb-1 is related to lecanoromycetes rather than to eurotiomycetes .
t. lanuginosus is placed in the class eurotiomycetes as same as the phylogenetic tree constructed with the ssu rdna sequences ( figure 2 ) .
phylogenetic analyses using the its1 and its2 sequences were not carried out because its sequences related to those of rb-1 which are suitable for construction of phylogenetic trees with high confidence could not be retrieved from the ddbj / genbank / embl databases .
rb-1 grew by consuming glucose and producing acetate and ethanol as fermentation products under both aerobic ( figure 4(a ) ) and anaerobic ( figure 4(b ) ) conditions .
other possible products including secondary organic compounds , such as hydrogen , succinate , pyruvate , formate , citrate , lactate , glycerol , isopropanol , acetone , propionate , butyrate , glyoxalate , and malonate , were not detected .
glucose was completely consumed in both aerobic and anaerobic cultures and growth was not terminated if the ph of the cultures was stabilized with caco3 ; acetate and ethanol produced in the ph - stabilized aerobic culture were consumed immediately after the exhaustion of glucose ( data not shown ) .
the available initial ph for the growth of rb-1 ranged between 2.5 and 8.0 with an optimum ph of 5.06.0 .
rb-1 grew at temperatures between 4 and 37c , with an optimum around 2530c . at 37c ,
conidium development was more prolific at 25c . in both static aerobic and anaerobic liquid cultures
, rb-1 always grew as a spherical cotton ball on the bottom of the flasks or tubes but not as a floating mat or pellicle .
rb-1 could use d - glucose , d - galactose , d - mannose , d - fructose , d - xylose , l - arabinose , sucrose , maltose , cellobiose , trehalose , raffinose , starch , inulin , xylan , and pectin as fermentation and growth substrates .
fermentation on trehalose , inulin , and xylan was much weaker than that on other available substrates .
all these substrates supported growth and were fermented to acetate , ethanol , and carbon dioxide . in the aerobic cultures ,
all substrates that were fermentable under anaerobic conditions were also converted to ethanol and acetate . on the other hand ,
rb-1 did not use l - rhamnose , lactose , melibiose , d - mannitol , d - sorbitol , glycerol , avicell , carboxymethylcellulose , or chitin as fermentation and growth substrates . growth yield and quantitative determinations of ethanol and acetate production on d - glucose are given in table 2 .
more acetate than ethanol was produced under both anaerobic ( 1.8 fold ) and aerobic ( 1.9 fold ) conditions .
growth of rb-1 under anaerobic conditions ( in a cysteine - reduced liquid medium ) was sustained constantly from the initial culture after eleven successive transfers in the same medium .
because filamentous fungi are commonly recognized as obligate aerobic organisms , little interest has been paid to their ecological roles and functions in anaerobic environments , including flooded rice field soils .
accordingly , filamentous fungi have been considered to be less important constituents of natural anaerobic ecosystems ; few studies on anaerobic filamentous fungi in natural habitats have been reported [ 7 , 2729 ] . in the present study ,
the author reports on the isolation of a novel facultative anaerobic filamentous fungus from japanese rice field soil .
since no sexual reproductive organs were observed , from a morphological standpoint , rb-1 is currently considered a mitosporic fungus .
the morphological characteristics of rb-1 are closely related to those of thermomyces lanuginosus and thermomyces verrucose ; the former species has also been isolated from japanese field soil .
however , these species differ from rb-1 in forming single conidia from the conidiophores and their temperature profiles .
the phylogenetic statuses of t. lanuginosus and t. verrucose are indistinct , so they are currently classified as mitosporic ascomycetes ( anamorphic ascomycetes ) .
however , recently it has been shown that t. lanuginosus is placed in the class eurotiomycetes and in the order eurotiales based on the phylogenetic analysis using ssu rdna and its sequences   as shown here ( figures 2 and 3 ) . usually ,
certainly , there are relatively low similarities of the ssu rdna ( 92.0% identity ) and the d1-d2 sequences ( 82.1% identity ) between rb-1 and t. lanuginosus , which indicates that they are phylogenetically distant . according to the phylogenetic analysis based on the ssu rdna and lsu rdna sequences ,
rb-1 was probably placed within the class lecanoromycetes of ascomycota ( figures 2 and 3 ) although the precise phylogenetic position is currently unclear .
further phylogenetic studies using other markers such as elongation factors and mitochondrial rdna should be required .
thus , although rb-1 is probably an anamorph of an unknown ascomycete considered an incertae sedis within the class lecanoromycetes , the classification is still inadequate to define its precise taxonomic status ; therefore , further detailed taxonomic analyses will be needed for nomenclature .
rb-1 can grow both aerobically and anaerobically , unlike most other ethanol- and acetate - producing fungi ; almost all of which can ferment but not grow under anaerobic conditions [ 35 , 36 ] . in successive transfer experiments for confirming the anaerobiosis ,
the growth ability of rb-1 in the strict anaerobic liquid medium reduced with cysteine was steadily maintained even after eleven successive transfers .
a study of anaerobic growth of zygomycetes showed that strains that are apparently capable of anaerobic growth , but require extremely small amounts of oxygen for any growth , are diluted out during successive transfers in anaerobic medium , whereas a strain truly capable of anaerobic proliferation continues growth after ten successive transfers .
as far as known to the author , few facultative anaerobic filamentous  higher fungi  that can produce metabolic energy by simple fermentation , such as the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae , have been identified [ 28 , 29 ] . as shown in figure 4 and table 2 ,
the amount of acetate was higher than that of ethanol , unlike other fermentable ethanol - producing fungi ; almost all of which produce smaller amounts of acetate than ethanol .
a simple comparison can not be made because of differences in the culture conditions and media between those previous studies and this study ; hence the reason for this remains unclear , and metabolic analyses of rb-1 are ongoing .
this phenomenon is similar to that of the crabtree - positive yeast cultures in which ethanol production occurs under full aerobic conditions when sugar is present in excess [ 37 , 38 ] .
productions of possible compounds other than ethanol , acetate , and carbon dioxide in the culture of rb-1 were not detected .
if produced , their amounts may be smaller than the detection limits ( < ca .
0.10.5  mm ) of measuring systems ( hplc and gc ) used in this study .
interestingly , rb-1 shows a significant acetate kinase ( ack ) activity , thought to be found strictly in prokaryotic cells , during the growth under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions ( unpublished data ) .
the phylogenetic , biophysical , and biochemical features of rb-1 indicated here can be distinguished from those of other known fungal species .
hence , the author concludes that rb-1 is a novel fungus .   as rice fields that are usually exposed to rotating periods of irrigation and drainage during cropping ,
accordingly , microbial colonies will go through changes responsive to irrigation ( anaerobic conditions ) and drainage ( aerobic conditions ) .
moreover , plowed soils of flooded rice fields are heterogeneous environments in which oxygen concentrations differ from those of other anaerobic sites . for example , bulk soils below the soil - water interface are strictly anaerobic ; because oxygen is supplied through floodwaters and the aerenchyma of rice plants , the soil surface , the rhizosphere , and the rhizoplane are aerobic , respectively .
facultative anaerobes are probably more adaptable microorganisms in such atypical sites compared to obligatory aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms . hence , although the ecological role and function of rb-1 in rice soil ecosystem are currently unknown , the abilities of rb-1 to acquire metabolic energy and to proliferate in both aerobic and anaerobic environments may be advantageous in such environments .
previously , wada   reported that an unidentified spore - forming filamentous fungus colonized rice straws in submerged rice soil where the anaerobic condition was sufficient for sulfate reducing . recently , several researchers reported that when nitrate is supplied , many filamentous fungi can acquire metabolic energy in oxygen - limited and anaerobic environments by nitrate respiration and ammonia fermentation , respectively [ 10 , 11 , 41 ] .
a recent research indicated that up to 89% of n2o emitted from soils to atmospheres could be attributed to fungal activity .
all these findings suggest that filamentous fungi capable of growth in the absence of oxygen are likely distributed in anaerobic environments in greater numbers than expected ."	" a novel filamentous fungus strain designated rb-1 was isolated into pure culture from japanese rice field soil through an anaerobic role tube technique . 
 the strain is a mitosporic fungus that grows in both aerobic and strict anaerobic conditions using various mono- , di- , tri- , and polysaccharides with acetate and ethanol productions . 
 the amount of acetate produced was higher than that of ethanol in both aerobic and anaerobic cultures . 
 the characteristic verrucose or punctuate conidia of rb-1 closely resembled those of some strains of the genus thermomyces , a thermophilic or mesophilic anamorphic ascomycete . 
 however , based on phylogenetic analysis with the small subunit ( ssu ) and large subunit ( lsu ) rdna sequences , rb-1 was characterized as a member of the class lecanoromycetes of the phylum ascomycota . 
 currently , rb-1 is designated as an anamorphic ascomycete and is phylogenetically considered an incertae sedis within the class lecanoromycetes . "	"1. Introduction

36	"after 4  months of epo trial ( 40,000  ui / week ) and transfusion dependence ( four red cell transfusions per month ) , azacytidine was introduced at dose of 75  mg / m / day subcutaneously 5  days monthly per 11 courses .
[ correction added on 8 may 2015 , after first online publication :  76 corrected to 
after 12  months of iron chelation therapy ( ict ) , hematological improvement ( hi ) was reached ( wbc 3600    10/l , hb 11.8  gr / dl plt 141,000    10/l ) and ferritin level decreased ( 2756  ng / ml ) .
after hi , transfusion discontinuation lasted 6  months ( from november 2012 to march 2013 ) . in this experience , such as in literature , serum ferritin levels decreased progressively over time and deferasirox was well tolerated with manageable side effects .
platelets count remained normal and ferritin level continued to decrease ( 1758  ng / ml ) . in december 2013
he presented the following parameters : wbc 3170    10/l , hb 9.2  gr / dl , plt 185,000    10/l , ferritin 1469  ng / ml . myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) are hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis , peripheral cytopenias and risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia .
several prognostic scores of disease are based on anemia and transfusion dependence 25 . the international prognostic scoring system ( ipss ) ,
commonly used to predict newly diagnosed mds , is based on cytopenias , cytogenetic feature , and marrow blasts 2 .
the world health organization ( who)-based prognostic scoring system , used at any time during the course of disease , is based on who categories , hemoglobin level and cytogenetic features 3 . a new revised international score ( ipss - r ) was validated in 2012 .
more recently md anderson mds lower risk prognostic model ( lr - pss ) based on anemia and thrombocytopenia , unfavorable cytogenetics and marrow blasts , is validated to predict the prognosis of  poor prognosis  lower risk disease 5 .
the patient ( male ) was diagnosed in march 2010 , at the age of 60 with refractory anemia ( ra ) low - risk ipss and low - risk wpss : severe anemia , normal karyotype , bone marrow blasts inferior to five percent .
laboratory features were increased ferritin levels ( 500  ng / ml ) , normal vitamin b12 and folate stores , serum erythropoietin ( epo ) level of 110  u / l . no mutations of familiar hemocromatosis gene ( hfe ) were recognized .
the initial therapeutic approach for treatment of the symptomatic anemia was erythropoietin 40,000  ui / week and supportive care .
after 4  months of epo trial and transfusion dependence ( four red cell transfusions per month ) treatment was stopped 6 . in august 2010 ,
5-azacytidine was introduced at dose of 75  mg / m / day subcutaneously 5  days monthly .
the side effect profile of the drug was manageable , the treatment was performed for 11 cycles , but no erythroid response was noted 7 .
as a consequence of ineffective erythropoiesis and blood transfusions , ferritin levels increased . in september 2011 , he started deferasirox ( icl670 ) 20  mg / kg / day .
hematological restaging confirmed ra low - risk wpss , ferritin level further increased ( 4124  ng / ml ) .
the blood cell count was : white blood cell count ( wbc ) 2040    109/l , hemoglobin ( hb ) 7.9  gr / dl , platelet count ( plt ) 64    109/l .
after 12  months of iron chelation therapy ( ict ) , hematological improvement ( hi ) was documented ( wbc 3600    109/l , hb 11.8  gr / dl plt 141,000    109/l ) and ferritin level decreased .
transfusion discontinuation lasted 6  months , from november 2012 to march 2013 . in this experience , such as in literature , transfusion independence was obtained and maintained , reduction in ferritin levels was anticipated by a decreased transfusion requirement 817 .
in addition , deferasirox was well tolerated . during the first month of therapy temporary discontinuation due to increased serum transaminases
three year of follow - up of ict did not show any auditory or ocular adverse events .
after 18  months of deferasirox , severe anemia relapsed and transfusion dependence reappeared ( four transfusions per month ) .
platelets count remained normal and ferritin levels continue to decrease ( 1758  ng / ml ) . in december 2013 , he presented the following parameters : wbc 3170    109/l , hb 9.2  gr / dl , plt 185,000    109/l , ferritin 1469  ng / ml . hematologic restaging confirmed the diagnosis of ra according to who criteria , low - risk wpss . history and physical examination such as
laboratory features did not show any significant further data ( bleeding , vitamin deficiency , hemolytic syndrome , infections or other chronic disorders ) .
this case may suggest a possible positive effect of the drug on hematopoiesis of a low - risk mds .
major erythroid and platelet responses were recognized according to the international working group ( iwg ) 2006 criteria 8 .
a possible hypothesis of the erythroid relapse may be genomic instability of mds itself plus reactive oxygen species due to iron excess consequence of ineffective erythropoiesis and blood transfusions .
another possibility may be the occurrence of additive  noxa  effect on the hemopoietic tissue or stromal cells ( fig.1 ) .
hemoglobin and serum ferritin changes before and after erythropoietin ( epo ) , azacitidine ( aza ) and deferasirox ( a ) .
platelet count and serum ferritin changes before and after erythropoietin , azacitidine and deferasirox ( b ) .
interestingly , ict was continued until the last follow - up , november 2014 , with good compliance and stable hematologic parameters : hemoglobin , platelet , and ferritin level .
treatment of mds varies according to risk group . lower serum epo ( < 500  mu / ml ) and a lower pretreatment red blood transfusion ( rbc ) requirement ( < 2 units per months )
aza is generally administered at a dose of 75  mg / m / day subcutaneously for 7  day in patients with progressing or high - risk disease . in this patient ,
category 2 according to lr - pss ( anemia , thrombocytopenia , and age ) an alternative 5-day schedule of aza was used 7 .
it seems rationale , as reviewers and guidelines suggest , an earlier introduction of ict in transfusion - dependent mds ( 2025 rbc units , serum ferritin > 1000 or > 2000  ng / ml ) in order to reduce the body iron burden and further toxicities .
it is of interest to determine factors associated with hematologic response and mechanisms of relapse .
reduction in oxidative stress has been proposed as main explanation for this improvement and alternative mechanisms may include redistribution of iron , effect on bone marrow microenvironments or on the neoplastic clone 817 .
rbc transfusion dependence is observed in higher risk mds but also contributes to iron overload in lower risk disease due to increased absorption of iron from the gut .
hecpidin , a key negative regulator of iron export from gut and macrophages , is typically suppressed in conditions such as thalassemia or ineffective erythropoiesis 18 . more recently ,
humans lack a physiological excretion mechanism for excess iron and each rbc unit contains approximately 200250  mg of elemental iron 18 .
in addition , excess iron has been shown to suppress erythropoiesis , as evidenced by decreased burst - forming units erythroid ( bfu - e ) in patients with elevated ferritin 20 .
this pathological form of nontransferrin - bound iron ( ntbi ) that take up by cells , lead to a rise in labile iron pool ( lip ) and generate reactive oxygen species ( ros ) .
it is well known that oxidative stress leads to oxidation of proteins , lipids , and dna with increased apoptosis , organ damage , and genomic instability 21,13 .
22 observed that the drug is also active nf - kb inhibitor in mds , suggesting a possible role in reducing the transcription of antiapoptotic factor that may have an effect on erythroid inefficacy .
there is evidence from retrospective studies that ict may improve overall survival ( os ) 917 . at the present time
, it is very difficult separate the prognostic impact of iron overload from the unfavorable impact of transfusion dependence as a biologic marker of bone marrow disease . regarding biochemistry parameters , transferrin saturation ( trs ) and serum ferritin
ferritin is also an acute - phase reactant and trs has a day - to - day variability 18 .
it is well recognized that red cell transfusion iron first accumulates within reticuloendothelial cell , thereafter macrophages release excess iron and organ damage occurred ( liver , heart , endocrine glands ) .
more accurate assessment of liver iron concentration ( lic ) is possible via invasive methods ( contraindicated in mds due to thrombocytopenia ) or via magnetic resonance imaging 18 .
several consensus groups have suggested guidelines on ict 2532 including parameters for initiation ( 2025 rbc units and serum ferritin > 1000 or > 2000  ng / ml ) , patient features ( life expectancy > 6  months or > 1  year and low / intermediate1 ipss ) , target serum ferritin ( < 500 or < 1000 ) .
few retrospective studies assessed organ overload in mds 917 . in addition , cardiac iron disease is reported only in a small fraction of heavily transfused mds 3335 .
therefore , in the absence of prospective clinical trial iron chelation should be tailored to individuals .
life expectancy and comorbidities ( especially renal impairment due to documented toxicity of the drug ) , accurate transfusion history and hepatitis ( which may affect the pharmacokinetics of the drug ) , serum ferritin or laboratory evidence of iron excess ( e.g. , hereditary hemocromatosis ) may represent key factors to make decisions about ict . comparing different series of patients
is difficult because of different duration of treatment or combination of iron chelation drugs , inclusion or exclusion of cases receiving other hematological modifying drugs , different decision making regarding red cell transfusion and response criteria .
principal clinical studies with deferasirox in mds patients lic , liver iron concentration ; lpi , labile plasma iron ; os , overall survival ; e / p / n , erythroid / platelet / neutrophil ; hb , hemoglobin ; ps , patients ; ict , iron chelation therapy . porter et  al . compare the response of iron chelation in mds and other anemias ( diamon - blackfan , b - thalassemia ) . similar manageable profile and efficacy were observed in different type of diseases .
furthermore , the changes in serum ferritin level correlated with change in lic suggesting the benefit of regular serum ferritin monitoring during treatment 23 .
the large 1-year epic study demonstrated that icl670 was safe and effective in reducing iron burden and lpi .
serum ferritin level decreased following 12  months of ict as confirmed more recently by angelucci et  al .
deferasirox , may represent an effective drug in lower risk mds after other treatment options . in this experience , such as in literature ,
reduction in ferritin levels was anticipated by a decreased transfusion requirement suggesting a possible positive effect of the drug on hematopoiesis .
reduction in oxidative stress may be responsible of the hematologic improvement but further possible explanation may impact on its benefit .
interestingly , major platelet response and ferritin decrease continue until the last follow - up .
toxicity and increased morbidity due to iron overload are well - recognized complications associated with hemoglobin disorders , thalassemia ( tdt ) , and sickle cell disease ( scd ) .
deferasirox is once - daily oral chelator approved by the food and drug administration and the european medicine agency for use in transfusion - dependent anemias ( tdt , scd and mds ) and nontransfusion - dependent thalassemia .
the experience with tdt is partially applicable to mds due to different pattern of tissue iron distribution , age and comorbidities , genetic instability .
furthermore , some high - risk mds patients do not survive long enough to accumulate iron organ damage 36,37 .
more biological and clinical studies are necessary to better define mechanisms of action of deferasirox and predicting factors of response 38,39 .
association of iron chelation therapy with other mds modifying drugs or support strategies may increase rates and duration of response , but accurate assessment of toxicities and a longer follow - up are mandatory due to moderate or elevate discontinuation rate ( 4080% ) , drug adverse events reported in these patients of over 60  years of age ( gastrointestinal and renal episodes mainly ) : table2 .
safety profile of deferasirox in mds studies ae , adverse events ; ps , patients ; mds , myelodysplastic syndrome ; gi , gastrointestinal ; uln , upper limit normal .
the severity of iron overload in mds is a complex entity which includes rbc units , serum ferritin level , and organ dysfunction therefore there is a clinical need for a quantitative , noninvasive tool for iron measurement in this subset of elderly and cytopenic individuals .
a prospective randomized phase iii trial , telesto , is enrolling patients to answer question of the role of deferasirox in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes and its impact on survival .
in addition , there are interesting phase ii trials ongoing : a phase ii study of deferasirox and erythropoietin in low- and int-1-risk mds patients and aza plus icl670 and/or vitamin d in higher risk mds ."	" key clinical messagedeferasirox , represents an effective iron chelator drug in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes . 
 reduction in oxidative stress is responsible of the hematologic improvement but further explanation may impact on its benefit . 
 biological and clinical studies are necessary to better define mechanisms of action , assess toxicities , and predicting factors of response . "	"Introduction

37	"lymphoblastic lymphoma ( lbl ) is a highly aggressive subtype of non - hodgkin 's lymphoma ( nhl ) , and it accounts for about 2% of all nhls .
the majority of acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( alls ) are of the immature b - cell phenotype , whereas approximately 90% of lbl are of the immature t - cell phenotype [ 2 , 3 ] . the natural history of b - lbl has not been well defined , and molecular studies are lacking because the literature is limited to small series and case reports .
however , it is known that b - lbl has a predilection for children . in 1 study , a review of previous literatures reporting b - lbl in 105 patients , 64% ( 63 of 98 ) of patients for whom the age at diagnosis was available were younger than 18 years . in korea ,
the incidence of b - lbl has been reported to be 11.6% ( 42 of 360 cases ) in children with nhl , and only 0.12% ( 1 of 802 cases ) in adults with nhl .
patients with b - lbl mostly present with extranodal involvement sparing the bone marrow [ 4 , 7 ] . the most affected sites are skin ( 33% ) , lymph node ( 22% ) , bone ( 19% ) , and mediastinum ( 5% ) .
although skin is the most affected site , primary involvement of the skin is a rare manifestation of b - lbl because cutaneous b - lbl usually presents secondary to systemic nodal b - lbl [ 8 , 9 ] .
here we report a 78-year - old man with a single cutaneous lesion of b - lbl at diagnosis .
in september 2009 , a 78-year - old man visited the seoul veterans hospital with a dark red - colored mass on the right upper quadrant , which he had had for several months .
the mass was approximately 5060 mm in size , non - tender , non - itching , and round , and had a smooth surface ( fig .
there were no palpable enlarged lymph nodes or any other skin lesions in any region , including the neck , axilla , and groin .
he was subsequently transferred to the korea cancer center hospital for a further work - up .
a complete blood count revealed normal values , as follows ; white blood cell count , 6.7810/l ; platelet count , 24310/l ; and hemoglobin , 14.0 g / dl .
u / l ( normal range , 4 - 43 u / l ) , alanine transaminase , 15 u / l ( normal range , 8 - 38 u / l ) ; uric acid , 6.7 mg / dl ( normal range , 3.4 - 7.0 mg / dl ) ; lactate dehydrogenase , 286 u / l ( normal range , 240 - 480 u / l ) ; and alkaline phosphatase , 57 u / l ( normal range , 40 - 129 u / l ) . computed tomography ( ct ) of the chest showed normal findings .
however , abdominal and pelvic ct scans depicted a 4-cm sized , discoid , highly attenuating mass in the skin of the right upper aspect of the abdomen without demonstrably enlarged lymph nodes .
f - fluorodeoxyglucose ( fdg ) positron emission tomography ( pet)/ct visualized a single hypermetabolic lesion in the abdominal wall ( standardized uptake value [ suv]=12.8 ) ( fig . 1c ) . a microscopic examination of the biopsied specimen revealed small malignant cells with fine chromatin , convoluted nuclear membranes , and scant cytoplasm infiltrating the dermis ( fig .
staining , atypical cells showed positivity for b - cell lineage markers ( cd79a , paired box 5 [ pax5 ] , and precursor lymphoblastic marker ( terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [ tdt ] ) ( fig .
for staging , bilateral bone marrow ( bm ) and diagnostic spinal tapping ( for cerebrospinal fluid [ csf ] cytology ) were performed .
on the basis of the pathological diagnosis and clinical staging , he was diagnosed as having primary cutaneous precursor b - lbl , ann arbor stage iea ( only localized , single extranodal site involvement ) .
he was treated using the cyclophosphamide , adriamycin , vincristine , and prednisolone ( chop ) regimen ( cyclophosphamide , 750 mg / m ; adriamycin , 35 mg / m ; vincristine , 1.4 mg / m [ maximum 2 mg ] i.v . on day 1 ; and prednisolone , 100 mg p.o . on days 1 - 5 ) , which is not an intensive multi - agent chemotherapy , because of his advanced age .
for the same reason , the dose of adriamycin in the standard chop regimen was reduced from 50 mg / m to 35 mg / m . after the 1st chop cycle , the mass shrank and had a flattened surface , and after the 3 cycle , the tumor disappeared by gross examination ( fig .
furthermore , f - fdg pet / ct failed to depict a hypermetabolic lesion in the abdomen .
we concluded that he had achieved complete response ( cr ) after 3 cycles of chop therapy .
an additional chop cycle was then administered and the initial skin lesion site was subjected to 3,600 cgy of radiotherapy over 4 weeks . at 21 months after completing 4 cycles of chop treatment and radiotherapy , the patient was found to have maintained a state of cr .
primary cutaneous b - lbl involving only the skin without systemic disease appears to occur almost exclusively in children or young adults , and is extremely rare in older patients [ 7 , 10 ] .
furthermore , it appears to be predominantly located in the head and neck region [ 9 , 10 ] .
thus , the present case report of a single cutaneous lesion of b - lbl in the abdominal wall in a 78-year - old patient expands our knowledge of this disease . for a differential diagnosis ,
comprehensive ihc staining is crucial , but no single diagnostic immunohistologic pattern has been established for b - lbl . nevertheless , certain immunophenotypic patterns can help distinguish malignant lymphomas and benign lymphoid proliferations . the work - up for
the differential diagnosis of b - lbl includes small , blue , round cell tumors , e.g. , ewing 's sarcoma , merkel 's cell carcinoma , neuroblastoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , wilm 's tumor , neuroendocrine carcinoma , and metastatic small cell carcinoma , as well as other lymphoid malignant neoplasms .
b - lymphoblasts are positive for cd10 , surface cd22 , cd24 , pax5 , and tdt in most cases , while the expression of cd20 and cd34 is variable . in tissue sections , cd79a and pax5
are most frequently used to demonstrate b - cell differentiation , but the former reacts with some cases of t - all and , thus , is not specific . in the present case ,
small malignant cells were positive for lca , tdt , cd79a , pax5 , and bcl-2 , but negative for cd20 , cd10 , and cd3 .
these immunohistochemical findings were consistent with precursor b - lbl , although the cells were negative for cd20 and cd10 .
patients with b - lbl respond well to intensive multi - agent chemotherapy ( all - type regimens or intensive nhl - type regimens ) [ 4 , 13 ] . according to some reports ,
adult patients with b - lbl seem to have better cr rates and longer response duration than those with acute b - lbl treated with similar regimens .
in addition , it has been suggested that survival is better for b - lbl than t - lbl .
primary cutaneous and extracutaneous b - lbl are not different in the managements ; both conditions should be treated with intensive chemotherapy regardless of the staging results [ 4 , 7 , 13 ] .
however , our case was treated using the chop regimen because of his far advanced age .
morel et al . reported treatment outcomes by different treatment protocols in 80 adult patients with lbl . in that study ,
the cr rate with chop was 71% compared to 83% with the intensive nhl protocol ( lnh-84 ) and 86 - 91% with 2 different all protocols ( lala or fralle ) .
however , there was no significant difference in cr rate and cr duration among the regimens .
in addition , there was no significant difference between the chop and lnh-84 protocols in overall survival of ann arbor stage i to iii patients ( 2-year survival , 62% and 74% , respectively ; p=0.49 ) .
on the basis of the results demonstrated by morel et al . , we suggest that the chop regimen can be a reasonable second option in elderly patient who would not tolerate standard intensive regimens for lbl . the prognosis of patients with cutaneous lbl appears to be similar to that of patients with extracutaneous lbl .
some authors have reported that a proportion of patients without systemic disease at diagnosis might progress to advanced disease with systemic involvement , most commonly to precursor b - all over a period of days to months .
these reports suggest that primary cutaneous precursor b - lbl has the potential to progress without adequate systemic chemotherapy , and thus , cutaneous infiltrates might be an early manifestation of precursor b - lbl / lymphoma progression to diffuse disease . in conclusion , we report a case of b - lbl presenting with a single cutaneous lesion without systemic involvement in an old man .
this case suggests that the possibility of primary cutaneous b - lbl among several subtypes of cutaneous lymphomas be considered despite its rarity , when an adult patient presents with only skin involvement and has pathological findings compatible with lymphoma ."	" precursor b - cell lymphoblastic lymphoma ( b - lbl ) is an uncommon high - grade neoplasm of immature b cells . 
 it occurs predominantly in childhood with extranodal involvement such as skin and bone . 
 therefore , primary cutaneous involvement in elderly adults is a very rare manifestation of b - lbl . here 
 , we report a 78-year - old man with b - lbl presenting as a single cutaneous lesion which was immunohistochemically positive for leukocyte common antigen ( lca ) , cd79a , paired box 5 ( pax5 ) , b cell lymphoma-2 ( bcl-2 ) , and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase ( tdt ) staining , but was without systemic involvement . 
 the patient was treated using cyclophosphamide , adriamycin , vincristine , and prednisolone ( chop ) , and achieved complete response ( cr ) at the first response assessment conducted after 3 chop cycles . 
 after an additional cycle of chop treatment , radiotherapy was administered at a total dose of 3,600 cgy over 4 weeks . at the 21-month follow - up , he had maintained cr . "	"INTRODUCTION
CASE REPORT
DISCUSSION"
38	"mucoepidermoid carcinoma was first described as a separate entity in 1945 by stewart et al . and is most commonly found in the salivary gland[24 ] bronchi,[59 ] and liver .
a total of seven cases have been reported , and we report herein the eighth case and review the literature on the previous cases .
a 63-year - old woman was admitted to our hospital , following a 5-year history of left upper abdominal pain and abdominal distension ( the second affiliated hospital , school of medicine , zhejiang university , hangzhou , china , 2011 ) .
computed tomography ( ct ) scan performed by a local physician 1 week before admission revealed suspected pancreatic cancer .
she was then referred to our hospital for further examination and treatment . at the time of admission
, she complained of loss of appetite and nausea , but no jaundice was found .
the serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 ( ca19 - 9 ) was elevated at 500.1u / ml ( with normal range less than 37 u / ml ) .
the serum level of carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) , squamous cell carcinoma antigen , alpha - fetoproteins , and neuron - specific enolase were not elevated .
computed tomography scan revealed a solid mass , approximately 4.5 cm in diameter , located at the left upper abdomen .
the tumor was irregular in shape , and appeared to arise from the distal pancreas [ figure 1a ] .
the tumor was irregular in shape , and appeared to arise from the distal pancreas.(b)a splenic artery aneurysm existed near celiac trunk a laparotomy was performed and we found that the tumor arised from the pancreatic body and tail without breaking pancreatic capsule
the distal pancreas , spleen , and its aneurysm were resected [ figures 2a and 2b ] .
( a ) the specimen removed from the pancreas , the tumor arised from the distal pancreas without breaking pancreatic capsule .
( b ) the specimen of the 
 splenic artery aneurysm was near celiac trunk on pathologic examination , the size and the cut surface showed a milky - white solid and homogeneous tumor with a hard elastic consistency .
the tumor consisted of three types of cells , the majority being poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells with mucin products in their cytoplasm , and some moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a tendency to form ducts .
these epidermoid cells did not have definite intercellular bridges , keratohyaline , or keratin pearls .
no differentiated squamous carcinoma cells were detected in any part of the tumor [ figure 3 ] .
( h and e , 100 ) the tumor consisted of three types of cells , the majority being poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells with mucin products in their cytoplasm , and some moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a tendency to form ducts .
in addition , there were epidermoid cells and intermediate undifferentiated cells the cells of the tumor showed strong staining with antibodies to ck7 , ck5/6 , and cea , showed negative staining for ck20 , the proliferation index by ki-67 stain was above 30% .
the postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged 2 weeks after the surgery .
gemcitabine was used once but the patient had severe gastrointestinal side - effects , then she underwent oral xeloda for five cycles .

gemcitabine was used once but the patient had severe gastrointestinal side - effects , then she underwent oral xeloda for five cycles .
the first documented case of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of pancreas was reported in 1959 by franz .
ohtsuki et al . suggested four hypotheses to account for the pathogenesis of the squamous component in pancreatic cancer , namely : ( 1 ) from pluripotent undifferentiated cells into mucin - producing cells and/or squamous cells ; ( 2 ) from ectopic squamous cells ; ( 3 ) from metaplastic squamous cells ; and ( 4 ) from the squamous metaplasia of underlying adenocarcinoma . in our report , the mucoepidermoid cells stained positively for ck7 , cea , and ck5/6 , but negatively for ck 20 . based on the ck immunoprofile , considering the present case ,
thus , a close follow - up is needed , to allow early treatment in case of recurrence .
ct or us ( ultrasound ) imaging is hard to distinguish mucoepidermoid carcinoma from the other types of pancreatic tumors before operation . for our case , though the mass can be identified on the body and tail of pancreas , we can not judge the specific from the preoperative imaging .
only seven cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the pancreas have been reported , except that of our patient [ table 1 ] .
the ages of the patients ranged from 48 to 69 years , with the median age of 60.5 years , and five were male and three female .
the tumors were located at different sites of the pancreas ( two at the head , three at the body , two at the tail , and one at the body and tail ) and were all larger than 3.5 cm in diameter at the time of diagnosis .
all cases were advanced and every tumor grew invasively except our case , with six of the eight cases showing metastatic lesions in the liver and/or lymph nodes .
only one case was survival more than 11 months in previous cases and our patient merely survived for 12 months .
based on the experience of this case , surgery seems to be only modality which brings the hope of cure if the mass is resectable .
cases of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the pancreas mucoepidermoid carcinoma is thought to be a subtype of adenosquamous carcinoma , histologically characterized by the presence of two components : an adenocarcinoma and a squamous carcinoma , but stewart et al .
mucoepidermoid carcinoma is composed of three types of cells , including mucin - producing cells , epidermoid cells , and cells intermediate between basal cells and epidermoid cells , mixed in various proportions . as far as mucoepidermoid carcinoma of pancreas
be concerned , ordinary tubular and/or papillary adenocarcinomatous structure would not be detected in the pancreatic lesion , and cancer cells can produce mucin .
ultrastructural examination shows that some of the cancer cells possess intracytoplasmic lumina surrounded by bundles of tonofilaments , squamous , and undifferentiated cells with transitional forms .
our case should be designated as mucoepidermoid carcinoma rather than adenosquamous carcinoma which are composed of mucin - producing cells , epidermoid cells , and cells intermediate between basal cells and epidermoid cells .
in summary , mucoepidermoid carcinoma of pancreas can not be differentiated from pancreatic adenocarcinoma by the preoperative examination , and surgery is still the only effective treatment if the mass was resectable .
due to limited cases of this disease reported , the effective diagnostic and therapeutic approach can not be figured out ."	" mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the pancreas is rare . here , a 63-year - old woman with left upper abdominal pain and abdominal distension is presented . 
 her mucoepidermoid carcinoma was located at the left upper abdomen , arising from the pancreatic body and tail without invasion of pancreatic capsule . on pathologic examination , 
 the tumor consisted of three types of cells , the majority being poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells with mucin products in their cytoplasm , and some moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a tendency to form ducts . 
 in addition , there were epidermoid cells and intermediate undifferentiated cells . 
 she survived for 12 months after surgery . "	"INTRODUCTION

DISCUSSION
CONCLUSIONS"
40	"every year , more than 9 million babies die in utero or in the first few weeks of life , and the majority of these deaths occur in developing countries , where teratogens play a major role.1 in fact , the term  teratogen 
is used to designate products with teratogenic potential at clinical doses used in humans.2 it indicates an exposure to a physical or chemical agent that can interfere with normal development of cells and tissues and results in abnormalities and malformations in newborns.3 currently , reproductive toxicologists consider the four major manifestations of abnormal fetal development to be growth alteration , functional deficit , structural malformation , and death.4 teratogenicity can be triggered by many materials , such as medications and licit substances like alcohol , caffeine , and tobacco.3 despite the lack of information on the safety of drug use during pregnancy , most pregnant women will likely be exposed to drugs . indeed
, fetal exposure can occur either before or after a woman knows she is pregnant .
many epidemiological studies have demonstrated that using drugs is associated with an increased risk of birth defects,2 depending on types , timing , frequency , intensity , and duration of exposure.2 on the other hand , exposure to smoke , coffee , and alcohol during pregnancy can contribute to perinatal complications and poor neonatal outcomes , consequences that have been well identified in epidemiological studies .
effectively , maternal smoking during pregnancy is an established risk factor for miscarriage , perinatal mortality , low birth weight , premature births , and small babies.59 despite the risks , many women still smoke during pregnancy : 17% in england and wales,10 and 14% in the us.11 in lebanon , a study conducted by chaaya and collaborators showed that pregnant women were partially knowledgeable about the health risks of cigarette and water - pipe smoking , and they had permissive attitudes towards all forms of smoking .
moreover , almost one - quarter ( 23% ) of participants reported smoking during pregnancy , with 17% smoking only cigarettes , 4% smoking only water pipe , and 1.5% smoking both.12 smoking is responsible for 15% of all preterm births and increases the risk of perinatal mortality threefold.13 although caffeine has been demonstrated to produce birth defects and fetal mortality in animal models , its effects in humans at normal levels of consumption are much less certain . a high level of coffee consumption is however associated with an increased risk of fetal death ; it was linked to various adverse pregnancy outcomes , including fetal loss , birth defects , and fetal growth retardation.14 finally , drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause miscarriage , premature birth , stillbirth , low birth weight,15 and a range of lifelong disorders , known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.16 the most known , fetal alcohol syndrome , is one of the leading known preventable causes of mental retardation and birth defects.16 to our knowledge , no data exist about exposure of pregnant women to these substances in lebanon .
while the harmful effects of different medications and licit substance use during pregnancy may potentially constitute a major public health concern worldwide , few epidemiological studies have examined the actual prevalence of risky substance exposure during pregnancy and its relation to perinatal problems in lebanon .
these data are important when making recommendations to health - care providers on screening substance use during pregnancy and for helping pregnant women to avoid these substances .
therefore , this study aimed to assess risky exposure of pregnant lebanese women to drugs , tobacco , caffeine , and alcohol ; a secondary objective was to assess their effect on postnatal outcomes .
consecutive delivering women at term were addressed after delivery in five university tertiary care hospitals of beirut and mount lebanon between january and june 2012 ; one of the hospitals was public , while the four others were private . after oral informed consent
, women were interviewed face - to - face by trained interviewers ( interviewers were sixth - year pharmacy interns ) .
we note that preterm delivering women , complicated pregnancies , and women with non - singleton fetuses were excluded from the study .
one day after delivery , women were told about the objective of the study , which was to describe their exposures to and consumption of different substances during pregnancy .
anonymity and confidentiality of the results were ensured , but no incentive was given for participants .
a standardized questionnaire was administered to them , inquiring about the following characteristics and exposures during pregnancy : sociodemographic characteristics , parity , medical problems before and during pregnancy , drugs and supplements taken during pregnancy , exposure to water - pipe and cigarette smoking ( active and passive smoking ) , and consumption of alcohol , caffeine , and caffeinated beverages .
moreover , medical files of both mothers and their respective children were checked to confirm information given by mothers , and to assess the health outcome of the babies until hospital discharge : weight , height , cranial perimeter , appearance , pulse , grimace , activity , and respiration score ( apgar score ) at 5 and 10 minutes , and the presence of a medical problem requiring transfer to the neonatal care unit ( ncu ) . for apgar score , each of the five criteria is scored from 0 to 2 : 2 is reserved for strictly normal states , 0 for major anomalies , and 1 for all intermediate states .
the normal newborn has an apgar score greater than 7 at 5 and 10 minutes of life.17 exposure to drugs was firstly assessed by drug name , and further classification was performed according to fda classification of drugs during pregnancy:18 category a ( adequate and well - controlled studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester of pregnancy , and there is no evidence of risk in later trimesters ) , category b ( animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus , and there are no adequate and well - controlled studies in pregnant women ) , category c ( animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus , and there are no adequate and well - controlled studies in humans , but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks ) , category d ( there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans , but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks ) , and category x ( studies in animals or humans have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience , and the risks involved in use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits).18 drugs with mixed categories were classified according to the higher level of risk .
smoking , caffeine , and alcohol exposure were assessed by a dichotomous variable of yes / no exposure ; in the case of a positive answer , mean frequency of exposure was assessed . for neonates ,
weight at birth , apgar score at 5 and 10 minutes after birth,19 and health problems that required transfer to the ncu were evaluated ( fever , infection , respiratory distress , and severe hyperbilirubinemia ) .
babies were considered underweight if their birth weight was lower than 2750 g ; this broader definition than the usual one was adopted because of the low number of babies with birth weight < 2500 g. data entry and analysis were performed using spss version 18.0 ( ibm , armonk , ny , usa ) . for apgar score at 5 and 10 minutes ,
a transformation into logarithmic function to allow for a normal distribution of these variables was performed .
percentages were shown for qualitative variables , while means and standard deviation were given for quantitative variables .
the chi - squared test was used to compare between - group percentages , while student s t - test or analysis of variance were used to compare means between two or more groups , respectively . missing data were not replaced .
furthermore , multivariate analyses were performed : a multiple linear regression when the dependent variable was quantitative ( apgar scores for 5 and 10 minutes , and a logistic regression when the dependent variable was dichotomous [ underweight baby , medical problem that required transfer to the ncu ] ) .
backward stepwise models were retained , after ensuring models adequacy using appropriate methods ( normality of residuals for multiple regression and hosmer  lemeshow test for logistic regression ) .
probabilities were used for stepwise removal ( p = 0.10 ) and for stepwise entry ( p = 0.05 ) .
independent variables were age of the mother , geographical origin , body mass index before pregnancy , education level , occupation , parity , delivery type , medical problem types during pregnancy , weight gain during pregnancy , number of live children , delivery term , and exposure to medications and licit substances .
the absence of collinearity between factors was checked by verifying the correlation coefficient of items and the variance inflation factor of retained items , which remained lower than 10 .

among 367 consecutive delivering women who were approached , 350 ( 95.4% ) agreed to participate ; nonresponders expressed that they were not interested in participating . table 1 describes the general characteristics of the 350 women recruited from beirut and mount lebanon .
most of them ( 69.4% ) had a normal mean of bmi and a university degree ; 21.7% of participants reported medical problems , mainly anemia .
congenital malformations were detected in two neonates , and 16 neonates were transferred to the ncu due to medical problems .
the means of the apgar score done 5 and 10 minutes after delivery were 8.49 and 9.66 , respectively .
most of the women in our study were taking such supplements as iron ( 76.90% ) , folic acid ( 66.90% ) , multiple vitamins ( 66% ) , and calcium ( 48.9% ) .
a total of 259 ( 74% ) women reported drinking caffeinated beverages during pregnancy , whereas only 1.1% of them drank alcohol .
however , 47.5% declared being exposed to smoking : 32% were exposed to passive smoking , 6.3% were active cigarette smokers , and 8.3% were water - pipe smokers . among drugs , category b and c drugs were the most taken , with 72.9% and 34.9% , respectively , while category d represented 10.6% and there was a very low percentage for category x drugs ( 0.3% ) . in bivariate analysis , education level was not associated with substance and drug consumption , except for active smoking , which was significantly less common in university - educated women versus others ( 9.5% versus 25% , p < 0.001 ) .
women aged 33 years and older consumed significantly more alcohol and drugs of categories b and d than younger women ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , no significant differences were observed between geographical regions ( p > 0.05 ) ( results not shown ) . in order to test the effect of different sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as well as different behaviors during pregnancy on neonates medical problems , development and on the risk of having underweight babies ,
we found that active tobacco smoking was significantly associated with an elevated risk of medical problems ( p < 0.047 ) ; babies born from tobacco - smoking mothers had approximately three times more risk of having medical problems requiring ncu transfer .
coffee consumption may also be strongly associated with neonatal medical problems ( adjusted odds ratio [ aor ] = 4.37 ) .
as expected , we also noticed that having a late delivery is highly associated with a decrease in the risk of neonates developing medical problems , or having underweight babies ( p < 0.001 ) .
we observed that consuming category c drugs ( aor = 2.01 , confidence interval 1.064.02 ) or being a passive smoker ( aor = 2.2 , confidence interval = 1.134.31 ) were significantly associated with increased risk of having underweight babies .
active tobacco smoking was associated with a higher risk of underweight babies ( aor > 1 ) , but the results did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.151 ) . concerning the relationship between the apgar score and drug and other substance use during pregnancy
, we found that higher frequencies of weekly water pipe and of daily cigarette pack consumption were associated with a lower apgar score at 5 or 10 minutes .
the exposure to category d drugs during pregnancy was also significantly related to a smaller apgar 10 .
in addition , we found that having gestational diabetes was negatively associated with apgar score .
finally , exposure to category x drugs may negatively affect the apgar 5 ( p = 0.07 ) ( table 4 ) .

women aged 33 years and older consumed significantly more alcohol and drugs of categories b and d than younger women ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , no significant differences were observed between geographical regions ( p > 0.05 ) ( results not shown ) .
in order to test the effect of different sociodemographic and clinical characteristics as well as different behaviors during pregnancy on neonates medical problems , development and on the risk of having underweight babies , logistic regression models were used ( table 3 ) .
we found that active tobacco smoking was significantly associated with an elevated risk of medical problems ( p < 0.047 ) ; babies born from tobacco - smoking mothers had approximately three times more risk of having medical problems requiring ncu transfer .

finally , exposure to category x drugs may negatively affect the apgar 5 ( p = 0.07 ) ( table 4 ) .
our study evaluated the exposure of pregnant lebanese women to risky substances and their influence on birth outcomes .
we noticed that the participants were exposed to multiple factors that may affect the neonates health .
indeed , most of them drank caffeinated beverages ( 75% ) , while substantial proportions were exposed to smoking ( active and passive , cigarette and water pipe ) , alcohol , and drugs .
our results are more or less similar to those of others for coffee,20,21 smoking,22,23 alcohol,24 and drugs.25,26 for active smoking , they are lower than those of chaaya and collaborators,12 probably due to the higher education level of our population .
the high consumption of caffeinated beverages is not surprising , given that the use of caffeinated substances is not forbidden by doctors during pregnancy , since reports about its harm on the fetus are scant and inconclusive,27 as opposed to alcohol or tobacco consumption .
it is troubling , however , given that coffee consumption was associated with higher risk of neonates medical problems with a tendency to significance ( p = 0.064 ) ; in fact , the occurrence of congenital malformations , fetal growth retardation , small - for - date babies , miscarriages ( spontaneous abortions ) , behavioral effects , and maternal fertility problems that presumably resulted from caffeine consumption have all been reported.28 in a danish study of 7346 pregnant women , authors found that consumption of coffee during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of fetal death , especially losses occurring after 20 completed weeks of gestation.29 the increased risk was linked to various adverse pregnancy outcomes , including fetal loss , birth defects , fetal growth retardation , and increased number of uterine contraction peaks .
thus , coffee consumption during pregnancy has been subject to preventive action in some countries,30 and was recommended to be restricted by several researchers.31,32 on the other hand , the trend we found may be due to the fact that caffeine is present at different concentrations in many beverages , including coffee , tea , and colas , as well as chocolate , and in our study we did not differentiate and divide our analysis into the types of caffeinated beverages , but took all in at once .
several other associations of substance use during pregnancy emerged from this study : our results showed a significant association between mothers tobacco smoking and elevated risk of medical problems .
indeed , babies born from tobacco - smoking mothers had approximately three times more risk of having medical problems requiring ncu transfer . paralleling our results ,
numerous studies have shown strong associations between maternal cigarette smoking and neonatal morbidity and mortality.3335 in other studies , smoking was recognized as a major risk factor for poor birth outcomes that needed transfer to the ncu.36 furthermore , some researchers found that maternal smoking was associated with an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome .
krl and collaborators confirmed that active smoking during pregnancy had a negative effect on the cerebral mass of the neonate ; the deficiency in cerebral mass increased with greater smoking intensity.37 the risk to the developing fetus seems primarily due to the nicotine : the biological mechanisms of how nicotine affects fetal development have been examined in extensive human and laboratory studies , which showed that nicotine crosses the placenta and targets specific neurotransmitter receptors in the fetal brain , eliciting abnormal cell proliferation and increasing susceptibility to hypoxia - induced brain damage.3,38 in addition , we demonstrated , consistently with other research,30 that babies born to women who smoked a water pipe during pregnancy had a higher proportion of immediate need for extra medical or emergency care . for active cigarette smoking ,
although we found a relationship between active smoking and underweight , the relationship we found did not reach statistical significance , probably due to the low prevalence of active smokers or the low smoking dose .
similarly , we found a doubling of the risk of underweight in babies of women who were exposed to passive smoking ; this is consistent with other studies in which high environmental tobacco - smoke exposure was associated with low birth weight , preterm birth , and most strongly preterm birth.39 on average , birth weight was reduced by 120 g per pack of cigarettes ( or cigar / pipe equivalent ) smoked daily by the father.40 alcohol use was much less reported during pregnancy than other substances ( 1.1% ) in this study .
this is due to the low number of pregnant women that were reported drinking alcohol during their pregnancy .
our participants seemed to be consuming medications belonging to categories b ( 72.9% ) and c ( 34.9% ) , whereas category d ( 10.6% ) and x ( 0.3% ) drugs were much less taken .
this indicates that pregnant lebanese women may have been more likely to stay away from the most dangerous drug categories ( d and x ) , as might have been recommended by their doctor and/or pharmacist .
other explanations would be that they may have less access to or need of these drugs , in addition to social desirability in responding , or , they may be underreporting these drugs for fear of legal consequences of disclosing this information .
however , we think that the latter explanations are less likely , and we doubt that lebanese women are aware of the classification of drugs during pregnancy .
nevertheless , confirmation of drug use with urine samples would have given more credibility to prevalence rates ; further studies are suggested to take into account this last point .
our results are however similar to those of other countries : for instance , about two - thirds of women in the us take one or more prescription medications during pregnancy .
nevertheless , it was found that more that 90% of the medications approved by the fda from 1980 to 2000 had insufficient data to determine safety in pregnancy.41 in addition , in a national study done in brazil on 610 pregnant women , results were similar to ours , and category d and x drugs were taken during pregnancy in low percentages.42 furthermore , in the multivariate analysis , the use of these medications during pregnancy was associated with the newborn s status in several ways : category c medication intake was associated with underweight birth , while the use of d- and x - category drugs were associated with increased risk of immediate need for intensive care .
first , a selection bias is possible , since we worked with women who delivered in university tertiary care hospitals of the capital and surroundings ; they may not represent the childbearing lebanese population , particularly those of lower socioeconomic status from remote areas .
we expect our results to be underestimating the true prevalence of exposure to toxic substances during pregnancy .
moreover , the data are cross - sectional , and therefore no causal relationships can be inferred ; analytical results are presented indicatively .
second , the risk of developing birth defects depends on exposure , timing , dosing , and route of administration;2 this information was missing from our data , and while reporting substance use for analysis , there was no specification of timing of exposure , dose , or route of administration for these substances .
in fact , we did not collect information about these factors because of probable nondifferential memory bias ; this may lead to crucial differences in results between using substances in the first trimester and afterwards .
the information bias could also be differential , women with children who had health problems being more able to remember exposures than women with healthy children ; this bias is expected to induce false - positive associations .
third , a medical problem that occurred in newborns was not detailed because of the low number of babies that had such a problem , which precluded detailed analysis , and we could not perform any analysis on congenital malformations since only two cases were found .
finally , a confounding bias is possible , since we may not have taken all potential confounders into account or the sample size may have precluded showing some associations .
for example , although anemia would be expected to affect birth weight , it was removed from the final model in our study ; this may be due to an underpowering of our sample size or to a low severity of anemia , given particularly that the majority of women were taking iron supplements .
although larger - scale studies may be necessary to adjust or confirm our analytical results , we do not expect that drastic changes in essential results would occur , especially concerning substantial levels of exposure to some substances and medications .
our study demonstrated that lebanese women were exposed during pregnancy to medications and licit substances that affected neonates health .
some risk factors associated with neonatal medical problems were identified , including active tobacco smoking and coffee consumption . consuming category c drugs or being a passive smoker was associated with increased risk of having underweight babies .
higher weekly water - pipe exposure , number of daily cigarette packs , or exposure to category d drugs during pregnancy were associated with a lower apgar score .
our findings have implications for clinical obstetric practice and prevention and intervention programs : clinicians should screen all pregnant women for smoking , exposure to caffeine , and other substance use and give them appropriate advice and explain all risks that may develop while using these substances ."	" backgroundthe harmful effects of medication and licit substance use during pregnancy may potentially constitute a major public health concern . 
 our study aims to assess risky exposure of lebanese pregnant women to drugs , tobacco , caffeine , and alcohol , and to determine their effect on postnatal outcomes.methodswomen at term were addressed after delivery in five university hospitals of beirut and mount lebanon between february and june 2012 . 
 a standardized questionnaire was administered to them . moreover , 
 medical files of both mothers and their respective newborns were checked to confirm information given by mothers , and to assess the health outcome of the babies.resultsamong the interviewed 350 women , active and passive smoking of tobacco ( cigarette or water pipe ) , and consumption of category c , d , and x drugs were common during pregnancy in lebanon ; they were shown to negatively affect the neonatal outcome in multivariate analyses : they significantly decreased apgar scores and increased the risk of underweight and medical complications of babies ( p < 0.05).conclusionour study demonstrated that lebanese women were exposed during pregnancy to multiple medications and licit substances that affected the neonates health . 
 our findings have implications for clinical obstetric practice and prevention programs in lebanon .

Conclusion"
42	"approximately one third of patients with renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) have metastatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis ( synchronous metastatic disease ) , and 40% to 50% will develop distant metastases after the initial diagnosis .
synchronous metastasis of rcc to the ureter or the bladder , however , is extremely rare .
a 73-year - old woman complained of gross hematuria for the past 1 week . her medical history and family history were negative for gross hematuria .
she underwent a cystoscopy that revealed a sessile mass on the right lateral bladder wall ( fig .
1 ) . abdominopelvic computerized tomography showed a 0.9 cm sized enhancing lesion on the right lateral bladder wall .
a 6.45.3 cm sized heterogenous enhancing mass in the lower pole of the left kidney with left renal vein thrombosis , multiple small enhancing nodules in the pancreas parenchyma , and nodular thickening of both adrenal glands were also found ( fig .
chest computed tomography ( ct ) showed hematogenous lung metastasis and left mediastinal and hilar lymph node metastasis .
the mass was found to be sessile , 1.01.0 cm in size , and with indistinct demarcation .
the pathological analysis of the resected biopsy specimen revealed metastatic rcc of the clear cell type ( fig .
3 ) . the patient underwent target therapy with sorafenib 200 mg owing to the multiple metastatic sites .
five weeks after the target therapy , she fell down in the bathroom , sustained an intracranial hemorrhage , and died of accompanying hyponatremia and aspiration pneumonia .
metastatic bladder cancers usually come from gastric adenocarcinoma , melanoma , and adenocarcinoma of the breast and colon .
rcc is an uncommon source of bladder metastases , with fewer than 40 such reported cases .
frequent metastatic sites of rcc are the regional lymph nodes , lung , liver , bone , adrenal gland , brain , and skin . reported
metastatic sites in the genitourinary tract include the ipsilateral ureter , contralateral ureter , ureteric stump , bladder , and prostatic fossa .
patients with rcc metastatic to the bladder typically present with gross hematuria . in the majority of cases , there is a well - established history of rcc .
however , infrequently , the primary renal tumor may present initially as a bleeding bladder lesion . in this case , the renal tumor was found during the staging work - up of the bladder cancer .
bladder lesions are generally sessile , spherical protuberances into the bladder lumen . in this case , the bladder tumor was sessile . histological evaluation of the resected tissue is usually consistent with metastatic rcc . in this case , the pathological analysis of the resected biopsy specimen revealed metastatic rcc of the clear cell type .
the mechanisms underlying the spread of rcc to the bladder remain a matter of debate .
several possible mechanisms have been proposed , including hematogenous metastasis through the general circulation , retrograde spread of the tumor from the renal vein or renal hilar lymphatics down the periureteral veins or lymphatics that connect with pelvic organs , and direct intraluminal transit of tumor cells with seeding of the distal urothelium [ 1 - 6 ] .
rcc commonly metastasizes through the bloodstream , leading to the synchronous discovery of a widespread area of metastasis . in this case , the multiple metastatic sites , including the regional lymph nodes , lung , bladder , adrenal gland , and pancreas , lend support to hematogenous metastasis through the general circulation .
treatment options for rcc , particularly when metastatic , are limited owing to poor treatment response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
conventional surgical treatment remains controversial regarding the establishment of good criteria for its application and often results in poor treatment effects . before the development of target treatment agents ,
target therapy is now accepted as the standard therapy for metastatic rcc because of the superior effect of sunitinib and sorafenib , which target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet - derived growth factor receptor . for cases in which rcc is metastatic at the time of diagnosis , as in this patient 's case
, the decision of whether to perform nephrectomy is debatable . for severe symptoms due to primary carcinoma
, palliative nephrectomy can be performed , and nephrectomy is performed with an expectation of spontaneous regression or to improve the treatment effect and survival rate by reducing the total volume of primary carcinoma when systemic treatment such as immune therapy or chemotherapy is given . in doing so , careful consideration should be given to the patient 's performance status , position and degree of remote metastasis , types and degree of differentiation of carcinoma cells , size of carcinoma , patient 's age , and gender .
for the treatment of metastatic lesions in the bladder , transurethral resection , partial cystectomy , and radical cystectomy have been used .
although genitourinary metastases are generally considered to have a poor prognosis , long - term survival is occasionally reported .
prognosis has been reported to be good when only a single metastasis exists in the bladder , and follow - up without additional systemic treatment is possible after the surgical removal of the metastatic lesion in the bladder .
in addition , when carcinoma has metastasized to other organs at the time when rcc metastasis is found in the bladder , additional systemic treatment such as immune therapy is required . in this case , considering the patient 's performance status and the degree of remote metastasis , we decided that nephrectomy was not indicated .
thus , transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed and metastatic bladder cancer was confirmed .
chest and abdominopelvic ct and a whole - body bone scan showed adrenal and lung metastasis .
the patient was treated with target therapy with sorafenib owing to the multiple metastatic sites .
however , she fell in the bathroom and suffered an intracranial hemorrhage that resulted in her death ."	" renal cell carcinoma is an uncommon source of bladder metastases . here

CASE REPORT
DISCUSSION"
43	"hepatitis e virus ( hev ) , a member of the genus hepevirus , is a non - enveloped virus with a positive - stranded rna genome approximately 7.2 kb in length .
hev has been the cause of waterborne outbreaks of hepatitis in asia and africa and is a major cause of sporadic hepatitis in these regions .
acute hev infection primarily affects young adults and is generally self - limiting and resolves in 1 - 6 weeks , except in women during late pregnancy , among whom 20% mortality has been reported ; chronic hev infection has recently been reported in transplant recipients ( 1 ) .
it has been hypothesized that zoonosis is involved in the transmission of hev ( 2 ) .
hepatitis e virus and antibodies to hev have been found in a wide variety of animals ( 3 - 6 ) .
hepatitis e viruses were divided into 4 distinct genotypes : genotype 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .
genotypes 1 and 2 have been identified exclusively in humans , while genotypes 3 and 4 have been found in humans and several species of animals .
genotypes 1 and 2 have been isolated in asia , africa , and america ; genotype 4 has been identified only in asia ; genotype 3 has been found almost worldwide ( 7 , 8) . since 2000 , genotype 4 hev has become the dominant cause of hepatitis e disease in china ( 9 , 10 ) .
genotype 4 was proposed to be further classified into 24 subtypes ( 11 ) . in the present study , we identified 52 genotype 4 hepatitis e viruses to subtype the hev strains in eastern china .
in the present study , we aimed to investigate the subtype of hev prevalent in eastern china , and phylogenetically analyze the relationship between different hev isolates prevalent in this area .
a total of 125 human serum samples , which were tested to be positive for anti - hev igm using commercial elisas ( wan tai pharmaceutical , china ) , were collected from local centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) in jiangsu province by jiangsu cdc from 2010 to 2013 .
a total of 290 swine fecal samples were obtained from pigs ( aged 8 to 26 weeks old ) in zhenjiang city ( 80 samples ) of jiangsu province , anhui province ( 90 samples ) and shanghai city ( 120 samples ) from 2010 to 2012 .
the three areas have the sample culture and interregional mobility of people is very common .
all the fecal samples were converted to 10% ( w / v ) suspensions in 0.01 m phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) ( ph 7.2 - 7.4 ) .
fecal sample suspensions were then clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 minutes and 100 l aliquots of the clarified material was used for viral rna extraction .
total rna was extracted from 100 l of serum sample or clarified fecal suspension , using trizol ( invitrogen , usa ) .
reverse transcription was performed using the takara rna polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) kit ( takara , japan ) according to the manufacturer s protocol .
briefly , a 348 bp segment of open reading frame 2 ( orf2 ) , was amplified using primers e1 ( 5-aattatgcycagtaycgrgttg-3 ) and e2 ( 5-cccttrtcytgctgmgcattctc-3 ) for the first round of pcr and primers e3 ( 5-gtwatgctytgcatwcatggct-3 ) and e4 ( 5-agccgacgaaatcaattctgtc-3 ) for the second round .
the pcr cycling conditions for both rounds consisted of 35 cycles of denaturation for 30 seconds at 94c , annealing for 30 seconds at 50c , and extension for 40 seconds at 72c .
the expected dna band specific for the hev was excised from the gel , purified with the axyprep dna gel extraction kit ( axygen , usa ) and cloned into a pmd t - vector ( takara , japan ) .
both strands of the inserted dna amplicons were sequenced in a dna analyzer ( applied biosystems 3730 dna analyzer ; invitrogen , usa ) .
phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor - joining method and evaluated using the interior branch test method with mega software version 5.0 .
prototype hev strains used as references in the analysis and their genbank accession numbers are shown in the phylogenetic tree .

phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor - joining method and evaluated using the interior branch test method with mega software version 5.0 .
prototype hev strains used as references in the analysis and their genbank accession numbers are shown in the phylogenetic tree .
our results indicated that 19.2% ( 24.125 ) of the serum samples were positive for hev rna , while 9.7% ( 28.290 ) of the swine fecal samples were positive for hev rna .
sequence analysis based on the pcr - amplified products ( primer sequences were removed ) indicated that the 52 hev strains , including 24 from humans and 28 from pigs , all belonged to genotype 4 hev , which suggested that genotype 4 was the main genotype prevalent in human and swine population in this area during our sample collecting time .
the 52 genotype 4 hev sequences shared more than 81.5% - 100% sequence identities and showed 49 distinct nucleotide sequences . in order to identify the subtype of the 49 genotype 4 hev strains ,
phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the nucleotide sequences in the present study and other referenced hev strains retrieved from genbank and results were shown in figure 1 .
other 20 well - characterized subtypes of genotype 4 hevs in a previous report ( 11 ) were also included in the phylogenetic analysis , where the genbank accession were not marked with black or squares .
results indicated that the 49 genotype 4 hev sequences in the present study were divided into 6 different subtypes , belonging to subtypes 4b , 4a , 4c , 4e , 4 g and a new subtype , respectively . the phylogenetic tree was produced with a 348 bp orf2 sequence alignments of 49 strains in the present study and the reference sequences from genbank , using the neighbor - joining method and evaluated using the interior branch test method with mega 5 software .
the percent bootstrap support is shown by values at the branch nodes of the tree .
the white squares indicated the sequences from pigs and the black indicated the sequences from humans .
twenty - one of the 49 ( 42.9% ) genotype 4 strains were subtyped as 4b and shared 92.5% - 99.1% sequence similarity among themselves .
the 21 subtype 4b strains included 12 strains from pigs and 9 strains from human populations .
eight strains in the present study felt into the cluster of subtype 4a , and shared 91.1% - 98.6% identities among themselves , including four strains from humans and four strains from pigs .
the subtype 4c included eight strains from the present study , which shared 87.8% - 99.0% sequence identities among themselves , including six human originated and swine originated strains .
interestingly , four strains in this study could not be subtyped based on the defined subtypes , but closely clustered with several other strains in genbank , forming a new subtype , sharing 92.2% - 95.4% sequence identities among themselves .
three strains including two strains from humans and one strain from pig clustered closely together and were subtyped into 4e .
an increasing number of evidences indicate that hev is enzootic and pigs were considered as the major reservoir for hev infections in human populations ( 9 , 13 , 14 ) .
the zoonotic transmission of hev from pigs to humans has been suggested all over the world .
genotype 4 hev was the main cause of hepatitis e in china and involved in zoonotic transmission in several areas of china ( 13 , 14 ) .
the hev isolates identified from the same geographic region tended to cluster together ( 15 , 16 ) .
however , recently several studies suggested the hev strain from a certain limited region may have several different subtypes ( 9 , 17 ) . in the current study , we identified 49 genotype 4 hev strains and phylogenetic analysis showed these isolates could be divided into six different subtypes , among which five subtypes contain isolates from both humans and pigs and the isolates from human and swine population closely clustered together , suggesting these five subtypes of genotype 4 hev were involved in cross - infection between human and pigs in this area .
the first swine strain of hev was isolated and characterized from a pig in the united states ( 2 ) .
subsequently , many hev samples from swine in over a dozen countries have been identified . in the present study , although we did not classify the swine fecal samples according to the pig age because of the label on part of the collection plastic bags were missing unexpectedly , the overall positive rate of hev rna ( 9.66% ) was in agreement with several previously reports in other areas of china ( 13 , 18 ) .
hepatitis e virus isolates from human or pigs were divided into four distinct genotypes according to sequence and phylogenetic analyses .
recent several reports indicated that genotype 3 hev was prevalent in swine and human populations in several regions of china ( 19 , 20 ) .
however , the hev strains in the present study all belonged to genotype 4 , which may owe to the different sampling site and time . in the present study , 42.9% ( 21.49 ) of the genotype 4 strains belonged to subtype 4b , including 12 strains from swine population and 9 strains from human , which suggested that subtype 4b is the main subtype prevalent in swine and human populations in this area .
phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the subtype 4b in the present study clustered with several other genotype 4 hevs isolated from eastern china , while the other subtypes in this study clustered with hevs from other regions in china or other countries , suggesting subtype 4b hevs are indigenous subtype of eastern china while the other subtypes may not be indigenous to this area ."	" background : hepatitis e virus ( hev ) , a zoonotic pathogen , uses several species of animal as reservoirs . 
 swine is considered as the major reservoir for hev infection in humans . 
 genotype 4 hev is the dominant cause of hepatitis e disease in humans in china.objectives:although many researches revealed that genotype 4 hev is the main genotype that prevalent in eastern china , few researches have done to study the subtype of hev in this area . 
 thus , this study aimed to investigate the subtype of hev prevalent in eastern china.materials and methods : a total of 125 anti - hev igm positive human serum and 290 swine fecal samples were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) screening of hev rna . 
 positive pcr products were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed.results:from a total of 125 human serum samples , 19.2% ( 24.125 ) were positive , while 9.66% ( 28.290 ) of the 290 swine fecal samples were positive for hev rna . 
 phylogenetic analysis based on partial capsid gene showed that the 51 hev strains in the current study all belonged to genotype 4 , clustering into 6 different subtypes . 
 our results also revealed that some of hev isolates prevalent in the human and swine populations were classified into the same clusters.conclusions:genotype 4 hev in eastern china shows subtype diversity and some hev isolates are involved in cross - species transmission . "	"1. Background

44	"ludwig , adachi , and matzuzawa ( 2011 ) recently published the results of an experiment in which chimpanzees and normal human participants had been trained to make speeded manual discrimination responses using a touch screen . on each trial ,
a small central white or black square was briefly - presented on a computer monitor .
next , two larger squares ( one black , the other white ) appeared on the upper part of the screen .
the participants simply had to touch the square of the matching colour as rapidly and accurately as possible .
after sufficient training ( always a concern with animal studies ) , the chimps were able to respond as rapidly as their human counterparts .
however , on every trial , when the two squares were presented on the screen , a high or low tone was presented in the background ( see http://www.pnas.org/content/suppl/2011/11/30/1112605108.dcsupplemental for a video ) .
both groups of participants responded significantly more rapidly to the white ( black ) square when the high ( low ) tone was presented than when the mapping was reversed .
crossmodal matches between distinct sensory dimensions , like here between auditory pitch and visual brightness , have been variously documented in human adults and infants over the years , and can be encompassed under the label of crossmodal correspondences ( see spence , 2011 , for a review ) . at the very least , ludwig et al .
's ( 2011 ) results provide one of the first examples that animals exhibit crossmodal correspondences much like the rest of us .
clever dogs tested by researchers in vienna . for while the latter canines could apparently match the sight and sound of a dog of the appropriate size , their gaze to a large or small dog image ( tested in a preferential looking paradigm ) was n't influenced by the presentation of a high or low pitched tone ( farag et al . , 2010 ) .
the latter result was taken to suggest that man 's best friend is simply not smart enough to make such symbolic , or abstract , cross - sensory matches .
the fact that chimps do is important for a number of reasons : first , because such results challenge linguistic accounts of crossmodal correspondences ( see martino & marks ' , 1999 , semantic coding hypothesis or the idea that these might be 
. 's ( 2011 ) results are all the more important in that they provide perhaps the first compelling demonstration that animals can match features between modalities in a way that is not simply explainable by their picking - up on an amodal stimulus property , such as shape ( as demonstrated by research on the crossmodal transfer of shape information between vision and touch ; e.g. , ettlinger & wilson , 1990 ; meltzoff & borton , 1979 ; parker & easton , 2004 ) , nor are they reducible to the pick - up of some sort of sensory equivalence between , for example , auditory and visual stimulus intensity ( see lewkowicz & lickliter , 1981 ) . that said , ludwig et al . (
2011 ) are certainly not the first to have looked for such apparently arbitrary crossmodal correspondences in animals : ettlinger ( 1961 ) tried , and failed , to show metaphorical crossmodal matches in monkeys . and while premack and premack ( 2003 , pp 216218 ) make the dramatic claim that monkeys systematically match round to soft and pink , and angular to rough and red in their book on the origins of intelligence , we have been unable to find any independent empirical support for this claim .
ludwig et al . ( 2011 ) argue that there was unlikely to have been any correlation between the dimensions of pitch and brightness in the chimp 's sensory environment . as such
, they could not have learned this crossmodal association or correspondence : hence the authors came to the dramatic conclusion that such crossmodal matching must be innate .
similar claims for innateness have also been made for certain other crossmodal correspondences ( shepherd , 2012 ) .
other researchers who are unable to find any obvious environmental source for a particular correspondence between particular sensory features ( or dimensions ) often use the term 
synaesthetic instead ( here meaning that the correspondence involves a surprising or unexpected pairing of sensory dimensions , e.g. , see walker et al . , 2010 ) rather than calling the phenomenon that they have 
discovered a crossmodal correspondence ( spence , 2011 ) or a natural crossmodal mapping ( evans & treisman , 2010 ) .
this places one on a slippery slope that leads from the finding that chimpanzees ' behaviour is influenced by a  synaesthestic mapping between the senses to the much broader claim that chimpanzees are synaesthetes . for many researchers ,
the latter term primarily refers to rare cases where certain sensory or conceptual inducers elicit idiosyncratic yet consistent , involuntary conscious sensory concurrents ( see deroy & spence , forthcoming ) .
the lack of evidence regarding the occurrence of a conscious synaesthetic concurrent should be sufficient to question the appropriateness of applying the term to chimpanzees .
furthermore , lewkowicz ( 2011 ) recently articulated the concern held by many researchers that there simply is n't enough genetic material to code all those abilities / behaviours that researchers seemingly want to suggest are innate , including probably crossmodal correspondences .
it is even doubtful whether we need to posit an innate basis for these correspondences is doubtful given the evidence that at least adults are able to learn novel associations between initially uncorrelated sensory dimensions very rapidly ( ernst , 2007 ) .
now where might the crossmodal correspondence between pitch and lightness have been learned ? in most natural environments ,
humans and presumably many other species ( e.g. , chimps ) have been shown to internalize such information in terms of a  light - from - above  prior ( adams , graf , & ernst , 2004 ) .
add to this the fact that smaller bodies or objects will , generally - speaking , make higher - pitched sounds when struck , sounded , voiced etc .
than larger objects , and further that smaller objects are more likely to be found in the sky than large objects ( elephants and whales were presumably never going to fly ) .
the suggestion that emerges is that there may indeed be an environmental association between lightness , pitch and size : smaller higher - pitched objects are , statistically - speaking more likely to be located somewhat closer to the source of ambient illumination and hence to be better illuminated and appear visually lighter than larger objects . of course
, many such suggestions regarding the environmental origins of such  surprising crossmodal correspondences ( see also walker et al . , 2010 ) have something of the unsatisfactory feel of the  just - so  stories popularized by evolutionary psychologists .
they are certainly hard to prove without some kind of environmental sampling of the statistics of the natural environment ( see geisler , 2008 , for a review ) .
one other possibility to consider here is that given that crossmodal correspondences are transitive , once the two former statistical regularities are learned ( lightness  size ; size  pitch ) , the mind / brain will also acquire the correspondence between lightness and pitch .
the two hypotheses ( direct or indirect acquisition ) might generate different models and predictions . what they both confirm
, however , is that looking carefully for the environmental source of such surprising correspondences , once demonstrated , may be preferable to many than the alternative claim that such phenomena are innate , or for that matter , that chimps are synaesthetic ."	"  are chimpanzees synaesthetic ?  an affirmative answer to this question appeared recently in a nature commentary on a study by ludwig , adachi , and matzuzawa ( 2011 ) that demonstrated crossmodal correspondences in both chimpanzees and humans . here 
 we question the claim that chimpanzees are synaesthetic . 
 we also question the claim that certain crossmodal correspondences are innate . 
 we suggest an alternative account for the crossmodal correspondence between auditory pitch and visual lightness in terms of the internalization of correlations present in the environment . 
 we highlight the limitations of such natural correlation approaches to the study of crossmodal correspondences as well as how such claims could potentially be tested in future research . "	"Introduction
Innate correspondences"
45	"acute respiratory infection ( ari ) is the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide , especially in young children .
respiratory viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , influenza virus type a and b , parainfluenza virus 1 - 3 and adenovirus are the most common pathogens affecting the respiratory tract of young children ( 1 ) .
human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections among infants and children worldwide ( 2 ) .
it was first identified as a novel respiratory virus in 2001 among children with ari in the netherlands .
the hmpv belongs to the paramyxoviridae family , pneumovirinae subfamily , and the genus metapneumovirus ( 3 , 4 ) .
the rsv is the most common etiological agent of viral lower respiratory tract infection and is considered as the most important cause of viral bronchiolitis in children .
respiratory syncytial virus belongs to the paramyxoviridae family , pneumovirinae subfamily , and is placed under the genus pneumovirus ( 5 , 6 ) .
the clinical presentation of hmpv infection ranges from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to severe lower respiratory tract disease accompanied by bronchiolitis and pneumonia ( 6 ) .
while rsv , influenza virus and parainfluenza virus are considered to be the most common respiratory viruses , the role of other less known viruses such as hmpv in ari children remains largely unknown ( 7 ) . despite studies showing the prevalence of hmpv infection , the actual role of hmpv in children with severe ari in iran
molecular techniques such as the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) are sensitive methods to define respiratory viruses that may be present in clinical specimens , especially in children suffering from respiratory infections ( 8) .
this study had two objectives . first , to determine the hmpv and rsv frequency and their co - infection in hospitalized ari children , aged less than five years old , at one of the children s referral hospitals in iran .
second , to describe the seasonal prevalence of hmpv and rsv among this group from march 2010 till march 2013 .
this descriptive study was based on the processing of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs from 158 children , aged under five years old , who were admitted to aliasghar children hospital of iran university of medical sciences with acute respiratory infections from march 2010 till march 2013 ; this was done for the determination of the frequency of hmpv and rsv infections and co - infections .
the ari children aged less than five years , having tachypnea with or without respiratory distress and cough , were included in this study .
the specimens were placed into a vial containing 1 ml of transport media and were sent to the payvand clinical and specialty laboratory , where they were tested by real - time polymerase chain reaction for hmpv and rsv .
nucleic acids from specimens were extracted using the qiaamp viral rna extraction mini kit ( qiagen gmbh , hiden , germany ) , according to the manufacturer s recommended protocol .
reverse transcription was performed with the use of random hexamers and superscript first - strand ( invitrogen ) , according to the manufacture s instructions .
real - time pcr was done using the rotor - gene 6000 from corbet research ( australia ) .
the properties of the oligonucleotide primers and probes of hmpv and rsv are shown in table 1 ( 9 ) .
the limit of detection for the hmpv and rsv real - time pcr are 100 copies per reaction .
there are no cross - reaction between both viruses and other respiratory viruses such as influenza virus a and influenza virus b , parainfluenza virus 1 to 4 , and adenovirus , implying a high specificity .
beta-2-microglobulin ( b2-mg ) dna was used as the internal control to monitor nucleic acid extraction .
the sequence of the primer and the probe of b2-mg are shown in table 1 ( 10 ) .
the pcr conditions were as follows : reverse transcription at 50c for 30 minutes , initial pcr denaturation at 95c for 10 minutes , followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95c for 15 seconds , annealing at 58c for 60 seconds .
the cycle threshold values of  39.9 were regarded as positive and cycle threshold values of  40 were regarded as negative .
the results were discarded for any specimen with a negative internal control . statistical analysis for comparison of relative values

statistical analysis for comparison of relative values was performed by the z - test , using the stata software version 8 .
from march 2010 to march 2013 , 158 specimens were obtained from hospitalized children under five years old for evaluation of rsv and hmpv infections .
the majority of respiratory specimens ( more than 65% ) were from children less than one year old .
overall , 31.1% ( 49/158 ) of samples were positive for rsv , and 5.7% ( 9/158 ) of the specimens were positive for hmpv . among the 158 patient specimens , 63.2% ( 100/158 ) were negative for rsv and hmpv ( table 2 ) .
( % ) twenty - seven ( 55.2% ) of the rsv - infected patients were females and 22 ( 44.8% ) were males .
five ( 55.5% ) of the hmpv - infected children were male while four ( 44.5% ) were female .
all patients with positive results for rsv and hmpv were divided into four age groups : < 6 months , 6 - 12 months , 1 - 2 years and 2 - 5 years . in the < 6 months group ,
the proportion of rsv cases was significantly greater ( p < 0.05 ) than the proportion of hmpv cases , while in the children with 6 - 12 months , 1 - 2 years and 2 - 5 years , the proportions of rsv and hmpv were nearly the same ( table 2 ) .
the seasonal distribution of detected viruses over the three - year study period is shown in figure 1 , during which two peaks of rsv infections occurred annually , first during december 2010 to february 2011 ( 31.4% ) and the second during december 2011 to february 2012 ( 53% ) .
the hmpv infections were mainly detected from december 2010 to february 2011 and december 2012 to february 2013 , when 11.4% and 15.4% of infections occurred , respectively .
from march 2010 to march 2013 , 158 specimens were obtained from hospitalized children under five years old for evaluation of rsv and hmpv infections .
the majority of respiratory specimens ( more than 65% ) were from children less than one year old .

the hmpv infections were mainly detected from december 2010 to february 2011 and december 2012 to february 2013 , when 11.4% and 15.4% of infections occurred , respectively .
the study shows that 31.1% and 5.7% of rsv and hmpv infections , respectively , occurred among iranian children < 5 years of age , hospitalized with acute respiratory tract infections .
the prevalence of hmpv infection in iranian children with ari varied from 0.49% to 54.4% , which was not previously reported in iran ( 11 , 12 ) . herein , the proportion of acute respiratory infection of hmpv - positive cases among children under the age of 5 in our study ( 5.7% ) was similar to studies from the middle - east regions such as amman ( 6% ) and other regions such as brazil ( 5.6% ) ( 7 , 13 ) .
there are also other reports on the frequency of rsv in hospitalized children in iran .
( 14 ) studied hospitalized children under five years old with acute respiratory tract infection and found a prevalence of 17.2% for rsv , and malekshahi et al . ( 11 ) assessed rsv among children less than six years old with ari and reported that it was the cause of 16.8% cases ( 11 , 14 ) .
( 15 ) observed that among 100 children with acute respiratory infection , 9% were infected with rsv .
the above - mentioned results were lower than what was found in this study ( 31.1% ) , which is more similar to the findings of moattari et al .
. they found that among 280 children under five years old , 84 ( 30.0% ) were infected with rsv .
there are several studies showing co - infection with rsv and hmpv ( 3 , 5 ) .
( 16 ) observed that 10 ( 3.5% ) of the studied patients were infected with both viruses , yet in the current study there was no co - infection with rsv and hmpv , which was similar to the findings of mullins et al.(17 ) .
the difference between the prevalence rate of hmpv and rsv infections and co - infection with both viruses in several studies may be described by different groups of patients , methods used for detection of viruses , yearly variation in incidence and other variables , such as age , population density , socioeconomic factor and climate changes .
it was also found that hmpv - infected children were older than rsv - infected cases .
the rsv was found predominantly in children < 1 year old , while hmpv infection occurred mainly in children aged 1 - 5 years .
such finding is similar to other studies on hmpv epidemiology ( 17 - 20 ) .
the reason of such difference may be explained by longer lasting maternal immunity to hmpv compared with rsv .
the hmpv seasonal distribution was determined by the peaks within the winter and the spring .
this finding was observed in other hmpv studies as well ( 8 , 21 ) .
in addition , rsv infection occurred largely during the winter months , similar to those previously observed elsewhere(5 , 7 , 22 , 23 ) . in accordance with several studies ,
the seasonal occurrence of hmpv infection mainly overlaps with rsv infections ( 8 , 24 ) .
hence it seems that hmpv is less important than rsv as a cause of ari , especially in children under one year old and the seasonal occurrence of both viruses is the same .
large - scale follow - up epidemiological studies are needed to fully explore all respiratory viruses causing ari in iranian young children and assess seasonally patterns ."	" backgroundacute respiratory infection plays an important role in hospitalization of children in developing countries ; detection of viral causes in such infections is very important . the respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) 
 is the most common etiological agent of viral lower respiratory tract infection in children , and human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract infections among infants and children.objectivesthis study evaluated the frequency and seasonal prevalence of hmpv and rsv in hospitalized children under the age of five , who were admitted to aliasghar children s hospital of iran university of medical sciences from march 2010 until march 2013.patients and methodsnasopharyngeal or throat swabs from 158 hospitalized children with fever and respiratory distress were evaluated for rsv and hmpv rna by the real - time polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) method.resultsamong the 158 children evaluated in this study , 49 individuals ( 31.1% ) had rsv infection while nine individuals ( 5.7% ) had hmpv infection .

 the rsv infections were detected in mainly < one year old children and hmpv infections were detected mainly in > one year old children . 
 both rsv and hmpv infections had occurred mainly during winter and spring seasons.conclusionsrespiratory syncytial virus was the major cause of acute respiratory infection in children under one - year of age while human metapneumovirus had a low prevalence in this group .

47	"erythema multiforme ( em ) is an acute self - limited polymorphous eruption , probably mediated by deposition of immune complex in the superficial microvasculature of the skin .
about 50% of em cases are triggered by identifiable factors , that include drugs ( 20% of cases ) and a viral or bacterial agent ( i.e. , herpes simplex and mycoplasma pneumoniae ) .
approximately half the cases are idiopathic.[13 ] most commonly involved drugs include anticonvulsants , phenothiazines , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , penicillins , and sulfonamides.[14 ] em minor presents with mildly itchy , erythematous , expanding macules or papules that may coalesce and become generalized .  target lesions 
a 34-year - old - woman was referred to our department because she had developed a macular  papular eruption involving the face , neck , arms , and trunk [ figure 1 ] .
the day before , the patient had been treated with oral prednisone and loratadine at the emergency room .
detailed clinical history did not reveal any significant medical disease , allergy , or skin manifestation .
twelve days before , she had started consuming a slimming drug preparation ( 2 or 3 pills twice a day before meals ) and pilosella tincture ( 40 drops / day ) , which is a herbal remedy used in cellulitis and obesity due to its diuretic properties .
the chemical composition of slimming preparation was pseudoephedrine hydrochloride 50 mg , theobromine 30 mg , caffeine 2 mg , vitamin c 100 mg , clorazepate dipotassium 1 mg , dehydrocholic acid 160 mg , magnesium stearate 2.4 mg , precipitated silica 0.8 mg , talc 0.8 mg , pregelatinized starch 156 mg .
we suggested her to discontinue these drugs and we performed allergological investigations on 4-weeks control . on this occasion ,
lesions had completely resolved , leaving moderate postinflammatory hyperpigmentation , especially on the neck area [ figure 2 ] .
patch tests ( pt ) performed with the sidapa 2005 standard series showed negative reactions . after 8 days we applied the second pt using the galenic preparations of the two drugs [ figure 3 ] : the pills were pulverized and then incorporated in vaseline 1% , and pilosella tincture was mixed in vaseline 1% too .
pills - pt tested positive on day 2 ( + / ) and 4 ( + ) and negative on day 6 .
intradermal test and oral challenge test were not performed : the patient 's mother , who was her guardian , refused because of the potential risk of immunologic reactions .
the laboratory tests showed normal blood cell count , protidogram , and liver enzymes , along with mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate .
the serological results excluded infections from hsv-1 , hsv-2 , ebv , and coxsackie virus a and b , borrelia burgdorferi , mycoplasma pneumonia , and klebsiella pneumoniae . given the absence of target lesions , a skin biopsy of a shoulder lesion was also carried out .
histopathological findings of an inflammatory pattern characterized by high - density lichenoid infiltrate rich in t cells , lymphocytes at the dermoepidermal junction , satellite cell necrosis , vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer , and dermal edema were suggestive of an em - type drug eruption[13 ] [ figure 4 ] .
the patient at presentation time : ( a ) face and neck involvement ; and ( b ) trunk and arms involvement ( a ) the patient at 1 month control , after having discontinued the slimming drug ; and ( b ) the patient at 1 month control , after having discontinued the slimming drug galenic preparations of the slimming drugs : pilosella tincture and thermogenic pills lesional biopsy of shoulder skin showing lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermal - epidermal interface and superficial dermis and vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer , likely a type of erythema multiforme eruption on 2 , 6 , 12 month follow - up , the patient had no more assumed slimming pills and similar eruptions never occurred .
the clinical history , the diagnostic investigations results and the 1-year follow - up findings indicate slimming pills as the triggering agent of the erythema multiforme -like eruption , excluding idiopatic em .
those slimming pills are also known as  food integrators with thermogenic activity ,  as they contain agents that are claimed to stimulate thermogenesis and increase metabolism and lipolysis ( ie , pseudoephedrine hydrochloride [ psh ] , theobromine [ tb ] , and caffeine [ cf ] .
the role of vitamin c ( vc ) is to hypothetically reduce the effects of the free radicals generated by lipolysis , whereas clorazepate dipotassium ( clp ) aims to mitigate possible side effects of psh .
the remaining substances ( ie , magnesium stearate , precipitated silica , talc and pregelatinized starch ) act as thickeners or as excipients . when considering these components , we focused our attention on those who were more likely to have immunogenic potential .
based on literature reports , we excluded cf , vc , and the four excipients / thickeners from analysis .
some reports indicate psh as the cause of severe skin reactions , including recurrent pseudoscarlatina and nonpigmenting fixed drug eruption .
tb ( 3,7-dimethyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1h - purine-2,6-dione ) , a methylxanthine , is a precursor molecule to pentoxifylline ( 3,7-dimethyl-1-(5-oxohexyl)-3,7-dihydro-1h - purine-2,6-dione ) .
pentoxifylline was reported to be associated with em in 12 people over the last 13 years .
in addition , theophylline ( 3,7-diidro-1,3-dimetil-1h - purina-2,6-dione ) , which is an isomer of tb , figures in the list of em - related drugs . given the chemical similarity between these three methylxanthines , we can hypothesize that the immunogenic potential of tb is similar to that of pentoxifylline and theophylline .
there are some reports of em appearing after intake of benzodiazepines and tetrazepam , which is structurally similar to clp . during the last 12 years
, 97 cases of em have been related to clp use : these cases were observed among a total of 4290 people who experienced clp side effects .
there are no reports specifically about em caused by a slimming drug preparation , and no studies have identified thermogenic stimulant pills as cause of either adverse skin reactions or em / em - like eruption .
our patient 's eruption probably resulted from the interaction between these four potentially immunogenic components ( ie , psh , clp , tb , and dha ) .
although tb has not been related with em or em - like eruption yet it could be considered as a possible cause , given its similarity with the other em - associated methylxanthines .
finally , psh and dha , which potentially cause rash and macular or papular rashes , may have contributed to the skin eruption too .
thus , our patient 's adverse reaction is likely to result from a possible summation effect : each component may have stimulated an immune response with different intensity and this interaction can have triggered the eruption development .
we then suggest that weight - loss compounds in slimming preparations should be kept in mind as a possible cause of drug - induced em - like eruption
. this would be particularly important in those countries where obesity is becoming a significant problem ."	" we report a case of a 34-year - old woman presenting with an erythema multiforme ( em)-like eruption . 
 lesions developed after a 12-day treatment with a slimming drug preparation ( food integrator with thermogenic activity ) and a herbal remedy ( pilosella tincture ) . 
 serological investigations excluded viral or bacterial infections . 
 patch testing with galenic preparations of both drugs demonstrated sensitization to the slimming drug preparation . 
 according to literature reports and immune - chemical properties , those components that are likely to have triggered the skin eruption are clorazepate dipotassium and theobromine . 
 their interaction with other two constituents such as pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and dehydrocholic acid may have caused the adverse reaction by means of a summation effect . 
 there are no reports specifically about em caused by a slimming drug preparation and no studies have identified thermogenic pills as cause of em / em - like eruption . 
 weight - loss compounds in slimming preparations should be kept in mind as a possible cause of drug - induced em - like eruption . "	"INTRODUCTION
CASE REPORT
DISCUSSION"
48	"all serious adverse events from clinical trials of mefloquine and all spontaneous reports of adverse events are coded and entered into the f. hoffmann  la roche global drug safety database .
events were classified using the standardized medical dictionary for regulatory activities ( meddra version 13.1 ) .
all reports entered from 31 january 1986 to the cutoff date of 26 october 2010 and marked as  pregnancy  were retrieved and evaluated .
summary cases ( ie , reports mentioning several pregnancies without the possibility to identify individuals ) were excluded from the analysis as standard procedure .
pregnancy reports were either prospective ( outcome of the pregnancy unknown at the time of first reporting ) or , less often , retrospective ( outcome of the pregnancy known at the time of first reporting ) .
the exposure periods evaluated were pre- and periconception and the first , second , and third trimesters .
pregnancy outcomes were categorized as follows : delivery , abortion ( spontaneous , therapeutic ) , and unknown .
fetal outcomes were : birth defect , normal infant or normal fetus , other disorder , and unknown .
birth malformation ,  as used by the march of dimes , refers to congenital anomalies identified by codes 740759 of the international classification of diseases , ninth revision ( icd-9 ) . using us federal documentation , we defined a pregnancy outcome of fetal death before 20 completed weeks of gestation as a  spontaneous abortion .  after 20 weeks
the term  teratogen  was defined as a drug that may have the potential to cause developmental toxicity given the appropriate conditions at clinical doses used in humans .
the prevalence of birth defects and the occurrence of fetal loss in the maternal prospective cases exposed to mefloquine were compared with the background rates in the general population , as published by various databases .
birth malformations in maternal prospective cases including deliveries and abortions were divided into subgroups based on icd-10 , chapter xvii ,  congenital malformations , deformations and chromosomal abnormalities ,  and compared with categories of birth defects from the march of dimes .
a total of 2506 cases of mefloquine exposure during pregnancy or in the periconception period were evaluated . the reports originated primarily from france ( n = 783 ) , the united kingdom ( n = 661 ) , germany ( n = 645 ) , and the united states ( n = 138 ) , with peak reporting from 1994 to 1998 .
most cases ( n = 2477 ; 98.8% ) were reported spontaneously ; a small number of reports came from the literature ( n = 26 ; 1.0% ) or from clinical studies ( n = 3 ; 0.1% ) .
most cases were reported by health professionals ( n = 2287 ; 91.3% ) , followed by consumers ( n = 103 ; 4.1% ) and regulatory authorities ( n = 36 ; 1.4% ) .
the mean age was 29 years for the maternal prospective cases ( range , 1552 years ; median , 29 years ) and 30 years for the maternal retrospective cases ( range , 1945 years ; median , 30 years ) .
the majority of cases were maternal prospective ( n = 2246 ; 89.6% ; tables 1 and 2 ) followed by maternal retrospective cases ( n = 227 ; 9% ; tables 3 and 4 ) and small numbers of paternal ( 5 prospective , 4 retrospective ) and both - parent ( 22 prospective , 2 retrospective ) exposure cases .
pregnancy outcomes in maternal prospective cases ( n = 2246 ) of the 2246 women , 221 were white , 22 were black , 6 were asian , and 12 were reportedly of  other  ethnic origin ; for the majority of women ( 1985 of 2246 ) , ethnic origin was unknown .
fetal outcomes were unknown in these groups ( pregnancy ongoing , unavailable for follow - up , and unknown ) .
fifty - six maternal prospective cases of other disorders with 78 events included various adverse events related to the pregnancy and delivery .
the most frequently reported were neonatal jaundice ( n = 12 ) , premature delivery ( n = 8) , placental disorder ( n = 8) , fetal growth restriction ( n = 6 ) , small - for - dates infant ( n = 4 ) , fetal distress syndrome ( n = 4 ) , stillbirth or intrauterine death ( n = 3 ) , bradycardia ( n = 2 ) , blighted ovum ( n = 2 ) , unspecified neonatal disorder ( n = 2 ) , and neonatal asphyxia ( n = 2 ) . the rest of the  other disorders  data set ( n = 25 ) included different pregnancy- and delivery - related reported terms , n = 1 for each reported item .
pregnancy outcomes unknown ( pregnancy ongoing , unavailable for follow - up and outcome unknown ) .
offspring status according to period of mefloquine exposure in maternal prospective cases ( n = 2246 ) pregnancy outcomes in maternal retrospective cases ( n = 227 ) includes 1 stillbirth with patau syndrome ( trisomy 13 ) .
offspring status according to period of mefloquine exposure in maternal retrospective cases ( n = 227 ) of the 2246 maternal prospective cases , 1383 with known pregnancy outcome resulted in 978 deliveries with 43 birth defects , 43 other pregnancy - related or perinatal disorders , and 889 normal infants .
this corresponds to a birth prevalence of 4.39% congenital malformations ( 43 of 978 births ) .
twelve women who delivered infants with birth defects had a medical history of drug abuse ( n = 1 ) , alcohol use ( n = 1 ) , hypothyroidism ( n = 1 ) , hepatitis b ( n = 1 ) , smoking ( n = 2 ) , preeclampsia ( n = 1 ) , spontaneous abortions ( n = 2 ) , previous miscarriages ( n = 2 ) , and family history of epilepsy or other unspecified mental handicap ( n = 1 ) .
six of these 43 women had no relevant medical history , and the medical history of the majority of women ( n = 25 ) who gave birth to infants with birth malformations was unknown .
with regard to the time of exposure , 2139 of the 2246 mefloquine maternal prospective exposures ( 95.2% ) occurred before conception and/or during the first trimester of pregnancy ( table 4 ) .
all congenital malformations occurred in infants of women who had taken mefloquine during this period of exposure ( table 2 ) . in the majority of spontaneous and therapeutic abortions ,
three of the 8 women who underwent therapeutic abortion and had a fetus with birth defects had a medical history of toxoplasmosis ( n = 1 ) , ectopic pregnancy ( n = 1 ) , or induced abortion ( n = 1 ) ; 1 of the 8 had no relevant medical history .
there was 1 birth defect in the spontaneous abortion group ( 1 of 112 pregnancies ) and 1 in the unknown - outcome group ( 1 of 416 pregnancies ) .
stillbirth ,  and 2 as  intrauterine death .  the first included narrative referring to stillbirth and death due to toxoplasmosis ;
of 22 prospective both - parent exposure cases , 14 ( 63.6% ) resulted in delivery and 1 ( 4.5% ) in spontaneous abortion .
the 14 deliveries resulted in 2 birth defects and 12 normal infants ; no other pregnancy - related or perinatal disorder was reported .
one of 2 women who gave birth to infants with birth defects was a tobacco user and had taken 250 mg mefloquine weekly for 19 days ; the other received the same dose for 50 days and her medical history was unknown .
as in the maternal prospective cases , 2 birth defects occurred in prospective cases of both - parent exposure ( after mefloquine use ) in the periconception period and during the first trimester .
the spectrum of birth defects reported in all prospective cases was divided into 10 subcategories ( table 5 ) .
characteristics of birth defects and associated pregnancy - related and perinatal disorders reported in all prospective cases cases may have more than one event .
seventeen other pregnancy - related events such as fetal growth restriction , neonatal hyperbilirubinemia , hypoglycemia , neonatal jaundice , polycythemia , premature infant , congenital pneumonia , unspecified congenital cysts , dermoid cysts , congenital hernia , intrauterine death , induced abortion , imminent abortion , and sacral skin dimple were reported in association with these malformations .
pregnant women traveling to chloroquine - resistant p. falciparum malaria - endemic areas need malaria prophylaxis .
in addition , women who use mefloquine prophylaxis may experience unplanned pregnancy and need advice on the safety of the prescribed antimalarial drug , particularly with regard to its teratogenic potential in the periconception and first - trimester periods , and information on fetal loss ( spontaneous abortion and stillbirth ) .
it is important that available data on drug exposure during pregnancy be routinely reviewed to enable evidence - based decision making .
furthermore , new policy decisions on use of mefloquine in pregnancy will be influenced by data on the safety of mefloquine in pregnancy .
this is currently of particular importance as it relates to global health because mefloquine is a potential partner drug in artemisinin combination treatments that will be recommended in pregnancy or for women of childbearing potential in endemic areas .
the drug safety database analysis showed an overall birth prevalence of 4.39% of congenital malformations in maternal prospective cases , with no specific pattern of malformations .
the exposure period of 95.3% of these maternal cases was periconception and the first trimester . to assess whether the use of a drug might be associated with an increased prevalence of birth malformations ,
the rate of birth defects found in the database analysis should be compared with the background rates in the general population , using various birth defect databases .
the prevalence of congenital malformations in the general population varied by country , pregnancy registry , and year of reporting . according to the march of dimes , approximately 4% of infants annually ( 1/28 )
are born with a major birth defect or congenital malformation , for which the etiology is largely unknown [ 1618 ] .
european surveillance of congenital anomalies reported a 2.37% total prevalence of major congenital anomalies in the years 20002004 .
the grouping of birth defects in our study was similar to the leading categories of birth defects in the general population as published by the march of dimes and the food and drug administration [ 15 , 16 ] .
the leading categories of musculoskeletal ( 11 of 978 , 1.1% ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , .6%2.0% ] ) , urogenital ( 11 of 978 ; 1.1% ; 95% ci , .6%2.0% ) , and circulatory ( 8 of 978 ; 0.8% ; 95% ci , .4%1.16% ) were comparable to findings in general population databases .
six of the prospective birth defects in our study were chromosomal abnormalities , which are usually genetic in origin and therefore probably not caused by mefloquine .
for a large proportion of the prospective spontaneous and therapeutic abortions ( < 20 weeks postconception ) , the offspring status was unknown , which precluded additional detailed analysis . among cases with known offspring status , most were in the therapeutic abortion group ( 8 of 293 ) .
the prevalence of therapeutic abortions with confirmed birth defects in all prospective cases in our analysis was comparable to the background rate of induced abortions in the general population reported in the literature .
we observed 3 stillbirths with other disorders , which was comparable to the background rate in the general population .
we did not have a control group and instead compared our data with available literature and other database sources , which is considered weaker evidence than a controlled study .
all observed differences in birth defects in the comparator databases could occur frequently as a result of sampling variation , coding , baseline factors , follow - up completeness , reporting years , regions , countries , environment , socioeconomic status , or lifestyle and may not represent true differences between the proportions of infants with birth defects in the comparison groups .
we focused on prospective cases , but data were available on fetal outcome in just 44.6% of the cases in our study , despite several attempts at follow - up .
we also list data on retrospective cases ( tables 3 and 4 ) , but these cases are not discussed in detail because retrospective reporting is known to be associated with bias and must be interpreted with caution
. a mother of an infant born with a major birth defect may be more likely to recall gestational exposures than the mother of a normal infant .
for example , bar - oz et al found that the rate of congenital malformations after first - trimester exposure to itraconazole was 4 times higher when ascertained retrospectively rather than prospectively .
furthermore , our analysis does not have the power to detect abnormal outcomes that occur at relatively low background rates or rare abnormalities , and the issues of long - term social or functional development can not be monitored .
the strength of our evaluation is its focus on the target group and detailed scrutiny of the evidence of mefloquine use in this group using a global drug safety database . to the best of our knowledge ,
ours is the largest source of information currently available to study the use of mefloquine .
most exposures documented here occurred in the periconception and first - trimester periods , a critical time for the fetus because first - trimester exposure is generally associated with an increased rate of occurrence of malformations .
mefloquine is known to cross the placenta and it has a long half - life , which ranges from 2 to 4 weeks , with an average of 3 weeks . because no single approach can delineate the entire spectrum of outcomes associated with drug exposure during pregnancy and to put our research into context , we screened all available literature on the use of mefloquine chemoprophylaxis in pregnancy using the search terms  mefloquine ,  
 our current evaluation supports the results of an earlier postmarketing data evaluation that had a data cutoff date of 10 september 1996 and showed no increase in congenital malformations in 1526 mefloquine - exposed women ( 4% ) over the expected background rate .
other literature includes early animal studies with mefloquine , which provide only weak evidence and can not be extrapolated to humans .
teratogenic and embryotoxic effects of mefloquine in these animal studies were observed after administration of doses usually in excess of 100 mg / kg . in comparison ,
the issue of fetal loss as  spontaneous abortion  or  stillbirth  in mefloquine - exposed mothers is important . in the 2246 maternal prospective cases , 112 spontaneous abortions were reported ( 5% ) , and 3 stillbirths .
this is comparable to background rates in the general population , where 1 in 7 ( 16% ) pregnancies result in spontaneous abortion and 1 in 200 result in stillbirth .
a large study in denmark showed that the risk of spontaneous abortion in women aged 2024 years was 8.9% , increasing with age to 74.7% in women aged 45 years .
the mean age of women in our maternal prospective cases was 29 years ( range , 1552 years ; median , 29 years ) .
although the scope of this article is limited to mefloquine prophylaxis use in nonimmune travelers , 3 important relevant studies of mefloquine prophylaxis in semi - immune pregnant women warrant mention here .
the first study was in 339 semi - immune pregnant thai women ( > 20 weeks of gestation ) , and mefloquine prophylaxis was well tolerated .
no significant adverse impact was observed on the mother , course of pregnancy , infant survival , or infant development ( up to age 2 years )
. a higher overall rate of stillbirths was noted for mefloquine users ( 11 in 159 vs 4 in 152 for placebo ) .
the authors concluded that mefloquine was safe and effective for antimalarial prophylaxis in the second half of pregnancy .
the second study [ 27 , 28 ] in malaria chemoprophylaxis and treatment involved semi - immune women in the mangochi district of malawi .
the study showed no significant differences in the frequency of abortions or stillbirths in women receiving chloroquine ( n = 3077 ) or mefloquine ( n = 1032 ) prophylaxis during the second and third trimesters . a third study investigating the pharmacokinetics of mefloquine prophylaxis in 20 semi - immune women in the third trimester of pregnancy found no abnormalities in offspring who were followed up until 2 years of age .
this study showed increased clearance of mefloquine in late pregnancy , with implications for an increased chemoprophylaxis dosage in the third trimester .
all other studies focused on nonimmune women who used mefloquine during travel . in 1 evaluation of malaria chemoprophylaxis ,
331 women exposed to mefloquine were compared with 153 women exposed to sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine .
fetal anomalies were lower in the mefloquine group ( 4.8% ) than in the sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine group ( 7.8% ) . however , the mefloquine group had a significantly higher proportion of spontaneous abortions ( 9.1% vs 2.6% ) , although this was still within the background rate for the population studied .
additional data on the use of mefloquine chemoprophylaxis in nonimmune pregnant women came from a case series of 10 women exposed in the first trimester of pregnancy   ( without malformations ) .
further data are published on us servicewomen   who inadvertently used mefloquine prior to becoming aware of their pregnancy during military operations .
they had a high rate of spontaneous abortions , which was attributed to stressors in the combat environment .
in summary , the prospective data shown here suggest that fetal loss and the birth prevalence of malformations ( 4.39% ) in mefloquine - exposed mothers were comparable to background levels in the general population .
this evidence corroborates the recommendation that inadvertent use of mefloquine in pregnancy does not constitute grounds for therapeutic abortions and provides guidance for women and their clinicians regarding the use of mefloquine prophylaxis in the pre- and periconception periods and during pregnancy .

slides were examined and photographed at 40 magnification , using an eclipse e400 microscope equipped with a digital camera ( model ds - fi1 ; nikon ) .
a second set of images were recorded at increased magnification , using an a1p mp upright microscope with a motorized stage equipped with a color camera ( model ds - u3 ; nikon ) and a 100/1.45 oil ( plan apochromat ofn25 dic ; nikon ) objective .
cell culture studies were performed to identify which cell types on the ocular surface responded to lps stimulation .
lps was added directly to either epithelial or dendritic cell ( dc ) cultures in vitro .
for epithelial cell cultures , cornea or conjunctiva explants were extracted from female c57bl/6j or tlr4ko mice .
conjunctiva explants were excised from the forniceal conjunctiva of 6- to 8-week - old female c57bl/6 mice or tlr4ko mice and left for 15 minutes at 37c in keratinocyte serum - free medium ( ksfm ) ( thermo fisher scientific ) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum , 1.25 g / ml amphotericin b ( product 15290 - 018 ; thermo fisher scientific ) , 0.5 l / ml gentamicin ( product 15750 - 060 ; thermo fisher scientific ) , and 5 g / ml dispase ii ( product 04942078001 ; roche ) . for cornea cultures ,
explants were left for 30 minutes in supplemented hormone epithelium medium ( shem ) containing dulbecco modified eagle medium / f12 medium ( product d8437 ; sigma - aldrich corp . ) supplemented with 5 ng / ml epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , 5 g / ml insulin , 5 g / ml transferrin , 5 ng / ml sodium selenite , 0.5 g / ml hydrocortisone , 30 ng / ml cholera toxin a , 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide , 50 g / ml gentamicin , 1.25 g / ml amphotericin b , 5% fetal bovine serum , and 5 g / ml dispase ii ( roche ) . corneal and conjunctival explants were then plated at one explant per well in 24-well plates .
conjunctiva cultures received 500 l / well of ksfm with 80 ng / ml mouse egf ( bd biosciences , san jose , ca , usa ) and cornea cultures received 500 l / well shem .
after 3 days , cornea cultures received 500 l of fresh shem / well for a total of 1 ml medium / well ; medium was changed every 3 days . for conjunctiva cultures , wells received another 500 l of ksfm on day 7 for a total of 1 ml of medium / well . on day 11 , wells were left untreated or treated with 1 l of 1 g/l lps dissolved in endotoxin - free water . after 4 hours ,
two to three wells were collected for each conjunctiva sample . direct stimulation of dcs by lps was also tested in vitro .
briefly , dcs were isolated from c57bl/6j mouse bone marrow and cultured for 10 days using rpmi 1640 medium ( thermo fisher scientific ) . on day 10 , cells were left untreated or treated with 1 l of 1 g/l lps dissolved in endotoxin - free water .
all statistical analyses were performed using prism version 6.01 software ( graphpad , inc , la jolla , ca , usa ) . within each experiment for pcr and immunobead assay analysis ,
1-way anova was used to determine overall statistical significance , and the holm - sidak multiple comparison test was performed to find differences between groups .
two - way anovas were used to analyze statistical significance between experiments , with sidak multiple comparisons test used to analyze the significance between groups of different experiments . for the pcr experiments where saline was used as the vehicle and for pcr analysis of the cell culture studies , an unpaired student t test with welch 's correction
was used to determine statistical significance among groups . for c57bl/6j mouse cell culture experiments ,
the number of samples per group were 4 samples per dc group , 4 samples per untreated conjunctiva cell group , and 5 samples per lps - treated conjunctiva cell group .
for the cornea , 2 untreated and 3 lps - treated samples were used to test for il-1. six untreated and 4 lps - treated cornea culture samples were used to test for tnf-. ct values were set at 40 for untreated dc samples that did not contain enough il-1 to quantify . for the tlr4ko mouse cell culture experiments , 5 samples were used in each cornea and conjunctiva group .
in the first set of experiments , lps eye drops were administered to nonstressed mice to determine whether tlr4 activation on the ocular surface could lead to the release of proinflammatory mediators .
gene expression was measured via rt - qpcr 4 hours after application of lps . in general ,
lps administration led to a dose - dependent increase in inflammatory mediator expression on the ocular surface .
concentrations of 0.1 g/l and 0.01 g/l were also tested ( results not shown ) .
lps concentrations of 10 g/l and 1 g/l led to enhanced expression of certain genes ( figs . 1 , 2 ) . in most cases ,
only small differences in expression were observed between the 1 g/l and 10 g/l concentrations , indicating that maximal tlr4 activation was reached at the 1 g/l concentration ; however , higher concentrations were not tested . in the cornea ,
application of 1 g/l lps significantly increased expression of il-1 ( 2.17  0.31-fold ) and cxcl10 ( 36.93  7.75-fold ) ( fig .
in addition , the conjunctiva displayed more dramatic increases in gene expression after lps administration .
for instance , 1 g/l lps enhanced il-1 ( 21.27  9.61-fold ) and cxcl10 ( 185  41.28-fold ) .
ifn- ( 13.45  4.49-fold ) , and il-12a ( 3.99  0.27-fold ) were also significantly increased in the conjunctiva after application of 1 g/l lps .
tnf- ( 7.02  3.37-fold ) and il-6 ( 20.12  10.48-fold ) were also increased after 1 g/l lps , but the results did not reach statistical significance . increases in il-6 expression ( 38.97  6.44-fold ) in the conjunctiva after 10 g/l lps did reach statistical significance ( fig .

increases in gene expression by lps were abolished or greatly diminished in tlr4ko mice . a slight and nonsignificant increase in il-1
was observed in the conjunctiva of lps - treated tlr4ko mice , which may suggest noncanonical inflammasome activation by lps . because no significant increases in gene expression were observed ,
these findings indicate the stimulatory effects of lps are mediated by tlr4-dependent pathways on the ocular surface . in order to verify that increased gene expression of inflammatory mediators also resulted in an increase in protein expression , concentrations of cxcl10
were measured by an immunobead assay in conjunctival tissue extracts obtained 24 hours after application of lps .

dry eye is a costly disease and is highly prevalent in the elderly . with an aging population and limited treatment options available for dry eye ,
it is important to define all the factors that can contribute to inflammation on the ocular surface .
toll - like receptors are known to promote inflammation , but their role in dry eye has not been fully explored .
tlr4 expression was found to increase in the conjunctiva in our mouse model of dry eye .
moreover , inhibition of tlr4 decreases expression of some inflammatory mediators during experimental de . however , additional research is needed to understand inflammatory mediators associated with tlr4 activation on the ocular surface .
theoretically , commensal or pathogenic lps - producing bacteria , as well as endogenous tlr4 ligands , could make a significant contribution to the inflammation observed in dry eye .
importantly , gram - negative bacterial sequences have been found in the normal ocular microbiome .
endogenous tlr4 ligands are thought to include extracellular matrix breakdown components , fibrinogen cleavage products , and heat shock proteins .
heat shock protein 70 has been linked to de , but the presence of other endogenous tlr4 ligands has not yet been fully investigated .
potentially , disruption of ocular surface homeostasis in dry eye could lead to generation of endogenous tlr4 ligands . despite this possibility
, the ability of tlr4 to produce a proinflammatory response in the eye during normal and diseased states has not been fully explored .
this study indicates that tlr4 is present on the eye and that tlr4 activation can lead to increased production of proinflammatory mediators .
in fact , lps application to the ocular surface can lead to the release of several inflammatory mediators linked to dry eye .
the greatest variety of inflammatory mediators and most dramatic rises in gene expression were noted in the conjunctiva ( fig .
this was expected , as the greater permeability of the conjunctival epithelium may make tlr4-positive cells more accessible to lps than in the cornea .
il-6 is one proinflammatory cytokine that was expressed in the conjunctiva after lps treatment ( fig .
additionally , tnf- appeared to increase in a dose - dependent manner , though it did not reach statistical significance .
tnf- is also important in th17 differentiation and has been shown to stimulate mmp-9 production in vitro , which can lead to further corneal epithelial disease .
both il-6 and tnf- have been found to be increased in mouse models of dry eye and in humans with the disease .
in addition to generating th17 pathway cytokines , lps administration also led to mediators associated with the th1 response .
ifn- is the defining cytokine of the th1 response , which contributes to ocular surface disease and tear dysfunction .
upregulation of ifn- by lps is important as ifn- expression is increased in mice and humans with de .
furthermore , ifn- has been linked to goblet cell loss and is capable of inducing apoptosis in the conjunctival epithelium .
increased production of ifn- after treatment with lps is also significant , in part , because of the ability of ifn- to amplify the immune response .
ifn- increases production of th1 chemokines ( cxcl9 , cxcl10 , and cxcl11 ) , which , in turn , attract greater numbers of ifn-producing cells .
also , ifn- increases expression of cd80 and cd86 on dendritic cells , which is required for t cell activation .
finally , ifn- leads to increased il-12 receptor expression . interestingly , il-12a , the main cytokine responsible for th1 differentiation , was also significantly upregulated in the conjunctiva after lps stimulation ( fig .
2 ) . upregulation of il-12a , in conjunction with ifn- , suggests lps stimulation can promote the th1 response that is critical to dry eye pathology .
it is particularly interesting that application of lps to non - stressed mice leads to production of inflammatory mediators in the cornea ( fig .
there are some conflicting findings in the literature as to whether or not human corneal epithelial cells can respond to lps in vitro .
figure 5 demonstrates cultured mouse cornea epithelial cells do respond to lps in vitro . in vivo ,
this study suggests that normal , unwounded mouse corneas can also respond to tlr4 activation in vivo . in the cornea ( and conjunctiva ) , lps administration significantly increased expression of cxcl10 and il-1 in ns mice ( fig .
1 ) . both the cxcl10 protein and mrna are known to increase in a mouse model of dry eye . increased cxcl10 expression has also been found in human dry eye .
similarly , il-1 , a proinflammatory cytokine , is increased in mice with experimental dry eye and in humans with the disease .
blockade of il-1 pathways during dry eye has been shown to be efficacious in murine models of de . in the end
, lps was found to enhance expression of cytokines and chemokines on a nonstressed ocular surface , which demonstrates that tlr4 activation could contribute to homeostatic immune surveillance .
the cell culture studies demonstrate that mouse cornea and conjunctiva epithelial cells , as well as dendritic cells , can respond to lps on the ocular surface .
the production of inflammatory mediators observed in the in vivo studies may be from a combination of direct and indirect stimulation .
figure 5 suggests that direct activation of epithelial and dendritic cells by lps is possible .
indirect stimulation of epithelial cells by lps - stimulated dcs ( or other immune cells ) may also contribute to production of proinflammatory mediators .
figure 5 demonstrates that il-1 and tnf- , both of which may stimulate additional mediator release from epithelial cells , were upregulated in lps - stimulated dc culture .
indeed , il-1 has been shown to increase production of il-1 and il-6 in limbal epithelial stem cells , and tnf- has been shown to increase cxcl10 production in human corneal epithelial cells .
although lps stimulation can lead to inflammation in a normal eye , this study suggests that tlr4 activation is enhanced during dry eye disease .
figures 4 and 6 display increased expression of il-1 in the cornea after lps administration when mice are exposed to ds .
this finding supports our hypothesis that disruption of the corneal epithelial barrier during de leads to greater exposure of tlr4 located in the wing and basal layers of the corneal epithelium .
tlr4 is then more accessible in the cornea , leading to greater activation by lps .
disruption of the corneal epithelial barrier has been established in our mouse model . however , other mechanisms are still a possibility , including increased cell surface expression of tlr4 in the corneal epithelium during de
. nevertheless , enhanced expression of il-1 in the cornea during de after lps stimulation may impact clinical severity . for instance , il-1 has been shown to upregulate mmp-9 , which can lead to disruption of the corneal epithelium . in turn
, this could lead to even greater exposure of tlr4 and contribute to a damaging inflammatory cycle .
surprisingly , figure 6 also shows that lps administration during de increases expression of il-12a in the conjunctiva .
more research needs to be conducted to assess the biological activity of il-35 on the ocular surface .
upregulation of il-12 by lps may indicate that tlr4 activation could be important in the early stages of dry eye disease .
microbial stress may lead to enhanced release of il-12 at the initiation of de , amplifying the intensity of the disease .
tlr4 stimulation could potentiate the induction of the de immune response by changing the cytokine milieu and activating th1-polarizing dendritic cells .
additional research is needed to determine the mechanism behind the increase in il-12a . in theory
considering this , increased sensitivity of those cell types to lps during ds is a possibility that needs further investigation . in conclusion
, this study demonstrates that not only is tlr4 capable of producing a proinflammatory response on the ocular surface but that response is enhanced during de disease .
tlr4 activation during de appears to be important , especially in the initial stages of de . in the cornea , disruption of
in the conjunctiva , enhanced expression of il-12a after tlr4 activation may promote th1 differentiation , leading to more severe disease .
the role of commensal bacteria and endogenous tlr4 ligands in activation of tlr4 during de also needs further exploration . despite this , the proinflammatory reactions produced by tlr4 on the ocular surface illustrate that tlr4 is a potential pharmaceutical target for dry eye inflammation ."	" purposetoll - like receptor 4 ( tlr4 ) alerts cells to the presence of bacteria by initiating an inflammatory response . 
 we hypothesize that disruption of the ocular surface barrier in dry eye enhances tlr4 signaling . 
 this study determined whether dry eye enhances expression of inflammatory mediators in response to topically applied tlr4 ligand.methodsa single dose of lipopolysaccharide ( lps ) or vehicle ( endotoxin - free water ) was applied to the cornea of nonstressed ( ns ) mice or mice subjected to 5 days of desiccating stress ( ds ) . after 4 hours , corneal epithelium and conjunctiva were extracted to analyze expression of inflammatory mediators via pcr . protein expression was confirmed by immunobead assay and immunostaining.resultstopically applied lps increased expression of inflammatory mediators il-1 , cxcl10 , il-12a , and ifn- in the conjunctiva , and il-1 and cxcl10 in the cornea of ns mice compared to that in untreated controls . 
 lps in ds mice produced 3-fold increased expression of il-1 in cornea and 2-fold increased expression in il-12a in conjunctiva compared to that in lps - treated control mice.conclusionslps increased expression of inflammatory cytokines on the ocular surface . 
 this expression was further increased in dry eye , which suggests that epithelial barrier disruption enhances exposure of lps to tlr4 + cells and that the inflammatory response to endotoxin - producing commensal or pathogenic bacteria may be more severe in dry eye disease .

Discussion"
50	"the aim of this study is to describe the management of cataract and refractory glaucoma in a case of congenital aniridia ( an)-1 .
in an 18-year - old female patient affected by congenital an , bilateral coloboma of the zonula and lens , cataract and glaucoma , pars plana vitrectomy , cataract extraction and subsequent transcorneal ciliary body argon laser photocoagulation were performed .
five years after laser treatment , the best - corrected visual acuity was 20/50 and the intraocular pressure was stable at 18 mm hg with topical pharmacological management consisting of timolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.005% .
from our experience , transcorneal ciliary body photocoagulation after cataract extraction and vitrectomy could be a useful technique to manage high ocular pressure in eyes affected by congenital an .
aniridia ( an ) is a haploinsufficiency of the pax6 gene ( 11p13 ) , presenting as total or partial absence of the iris .
multisystem diseases could be present , as this gene is also involved in the correct development of many systemic structures . from an ophthalmological point of view , congenital an is a complex embryologic malformation involving the iris , trabecula , cornea and lens .
increased central corneal thickness , cataracts , glaucoma , limbal stem cell deficiency , ptosis , nystagmus and foveal hypoplasia or foveal aplasia have been described [ 3 , 4 ] . the incidence of glaucoma associated with an has been reported to vary from 6 to 75% .
glaucoma associated with an typically develops during the first 2 decades of life and is attributed to progressive anterior rotation of the rudimentary iris , leading to angle closure .
it is typically resistant to medical therapy , and glaucoma management for this condition is generally surgical , but there is a lack of consensus among professionals regarding which surgical approach is best [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] .
we present the case of a patient affected by congenital an associated with cataract , lens coloboma and refractory glaucoma , who was treated with pars plana cataract extraction using vitrectomy and transcorneal argon laser photocoagulation of the ciliary body in the right eye .
the clinical condition of the left eye only required treatment with timolol 0.5% twice daily to control the intraocular pressure ( iop ) .
our patient was an 18-year - old female affected by congenital an associated with palpebral ptosis and lens coloboma with an existing cataract ( fig .
the absence of a macular reflex ( foveal hypoplasia ) with yellowish deposits in the retinal periphery was also observed . since the age of 5 ,
the patient had been treated with timolol 0.05% to control the iop of both eyes .
the iop , determined by goldmann tonometry , was 33 mm hg od and 23 mm hg os , and corneal central thickness was 674 m od and 637 m os ( orbscan ii ; bausch & lomb , rochester , n.y .
the patient underwent pars plana cataract extraction , with both lens and capsule removed , and anterior 20 g vitrectomy without intraocular lens ( iol ) implantation in the right eye .
after surgery , the iop was well controlled by timolol 0.5% . however , 20 days later , the iop began to exceed 26 mm hg , although it was not appreciable at the slit lamp evaluation .
forty - five days after surgery , the iop continued to increase , reaching values up to 35 mm hg .
these iop values were constant , although maximal ocular hypotensive therapy was added ( brimonidine tartrate 0.2% , dorzolamide hydrochloride 2% drops and 250 mg acetazolamide tablets , twice daily ) .
the procedure was performed with a solid - state 532-nm laser ( lumenis novus spectra ) .
the inferior temporal quadrant was treated first ( 80 spots , diameter 100 m , 250 mw , 0.3 s ) , and after 1 month , the inferior nasal quadrant was treated ( 103 spots , diameter 100 m , 250 mw , 0.3 s ) .
the power of the laser was regulated to obtain whitening at the head of the ciliary processes .
one day after laser treatment , the iop was 8 mm hg . during the successive months , it slowly increased , and 6 months after surgery , it was 28 mm hg without medical therapy .
one and 6 months after initiation of the therapy , the iop was stable at 18 mm hg .
moreover , after the first month , at biomicroscopy , the ocular surface evaluation performed with dye tests ( lissamine and fluorescein ) did not show a significant change from the preoperative results . in our case
, pars plana cataract extraction did not cause peripheral retinal tears , although the eye of the patient was affected by high myopia ( 10 diopters ) and no acute ocular inflammation was found .
after 2 , 4 and 5 years , the iop was still stable at 18 mm hg with topical timolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.005% , and the best - corrected visual acuity scores were 20/63 , 20/50 and 20/50 , respectively .
congenital an is a rare pan - ocular disorder , characterized by partial or total absence of the iris and associated with cataracts , glaucoma , limbal stem cell deficiency and foveal hypoplasia or aplasia . in the aforementioned case ,
the patient underwent pars plana cataract extraction without iol implantation . surgical glaucoma management in congenital
filtering or drainage implant , goniosurgery or cyclodestructive procedures can be effective but are controversial .
the choice to perform pars plana cataract extraction without iol implantation was made because the classical sclerocorneal approach , which is routine in cosmetic iol implantation , could have further damaged the limbal stem cells and produced a permanent deficiency thereof . moreover , according to lee et al .
, congenital an is a profibrotic disease , which could have negative implications for wound healing after surgery .
the choice to avoid iol implantation was further justified by a better exploration of the retinal periphery and ciliary body ( fig .
1d ) as well as the presence of high myopia ( 10 diopters ) in the patient 's eye . a cosmetic iol implant , in fact ,
would not have allowed us to treat the ciliary body with transcorneal photocoagulation , and traditional , surgical glaucoma procedures , such as trabeculectomy or implantation of a drainage device , would probably have led to failure , as has been described in the literature [ 9 , 10 ] . in conclusion , pars plana cataract extraction using vitrectomy , associated with transcorneal argon laser photocoagulation of the ciliary body , could be an alternative and valid way to treat cataract and refractory glaucoma in eyes affected by congenital an .
however , it is necessary to study and document a large number of cases to better understand this and similar pathological conditions as well as their ideal treatment ."	 purposethe aim of this study is to describe the management of cataract and refractory glaucoma in a case of congenital aniridia ( an)-1.methodsin an 18-year - old female patient affected by congenital an , bilateral coloboma of the zonula and lens , cataract and glaucoma , pars plana vitrectomy , cataract extraction and subsequent transcorneal ciliary body argon laser photocoagulation were performed.resultsfive years after laser treatment , the best - corrected visual acuity was 20/50 and the intraocular pressure was stable at 18 mm hg with topical pharmacological management consisting of timolol 0.5% and latanoprost 0.005%.conclusionsfrom our experience , transcorneal ciliary body photocoagulation after cataract extraction and vitrectomy could be a useful technique to manage high ocular pressure in eyes affected by congenital an .

51	"the aura is thought to be associated with leao 's cortical spreading depression ( csd ) , and cortical hyperexcitability is thought to be an important pathophysiological concept in ma . persistent migraine aura ( pma ) without infarction is a condition in which auras last longer than 1 week in the absence of radiological evidence of infarction .
we present an observation of pma with infarction , which was also briefly mentioned in our recent review on the pma literature , and discuss the implications of this finding in the light of current pathophysiological ideas with respect to ma as well as pma .
the attacks usually started with left - sided lightning flashes and coloured dots followed by unilateral throbbing headache . over the past years
, she visited our outpatient clinic with complaints of continuous visual disturbances that had started a few weeks before . for 2 months
she had been experiencing continuous zigzag lines and lightning flashes in her left visual field , which were sometimes accompanied by flickering lights .
the phenomena were similar to her typical left - sided visual ma , and she did not complain of headache or nausea .
an mri scan of the brain showed a small paramedian in - farction in the right occipital lobe ( fig .
it was more pronounced on a second mri scan in which a perfusion - weighted series was included showing a global perfusion defect in the same area ( fig .
the patient was diagnosed with migrainous infarction and received aspirin ( 100 mg daily ) . for the persisting aura we prescribed acetazolamide ( 250 mg daily ) , sodium valproate ( 1,000 mg daily ) and nimodipine ( 240 mg daily ) consecutively , but without any improvement of her complaints .
she decided to stop taking any preventive drugs and at the latest follow - up 2 years after the start of the continuous aura , she stated that the aura had disappeared and that she only noticed some visual spots on the left side .
our patient does not fulfill the criteria for pma as she was found to have a small cortical ischaemic infarction in the right occipital lobe probably associated with it .
the infarction was apparently too small to lead to homonymous hemianopia and instead produced positive symptoms for almost 2 years , finally leaving her with a non - detectable small negative spot in her left visual field .
several studies have shown that the cerebral cortex in migraine patients displays an enhanced responsiveness to various external stimuli [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] . in migraine with aura ,
visual stimulus processing is believed to be disturbed to the extent that it is more difficult for these patients , as compared to matched controls , to suppress the perception of simple targets .
the phenomenon fits into the concept of cortical neuronal hyperexcitability , which is thought to lead to csd in certain conditions .
it has been postulated as an important contributing factor in the pathophysiology of migraine . in pma
this cortical neuronal hyperexcitability is thought to be sustained , which could lead to reverberating csd . a possible mechanism for this presumed cortical hyperexcitability may be a lack of inhibitory control in the primary visual cortex ( v1 ) . in the human motor cortex
, it has been shown that the cortical stimulation silent period  a measure of local cortical inhibition  is shortened in migraine , which is another possible indication pointing to deficient cortical inhibition .
chronicle and mulleners   argue that it is conceivable that repeated ischaemic or near - ischaemic reductions of regional cerebral blood flow in the v1 during the aura phase of migraine give rise to selective damage to the gabaergic inhibitory network of sparsely spinous stellate cells .
the possible ischaemic damage of these cells could be responsible for the cortical visual dysfunction shown to exist in ma patients by a number of investigators .
up to the present , this damage has not been visualised in studies using mri because of its diffuse , ultrastructural and laminar nature .
another theory for cortical hyperexcitability in migraine is that beside reduced inhibition , there is a low cortical preactivation .
propose that reduced inhibition ( possibly by diffuse damage to gabaergic inhibitory network cells as stated above ) and low cortical preactivation due to thalamocortical hypoactivity may coexist .
the latter can promote the former via reduction of lateral inhibition during the stimulus repetition .
eventually , both will lead to an increased cortical response to repeated stimuli , i.e. a lack of habituation .
it is well - known that ma , particularly in women , is associated with cerebral infarction and vascular complications in general .
cerebral damage in ma has been demonstrated in several studies ; however , these concern white matter alterations in general .
we argue that our patient 's persisting positive symptoms following a migrainous infarction in the occipital lobe might be explained by cell dysfunction of a local inhibitory network in the right v1 .
the small infarction may have been responsible for an increased imbalance in one of the v1 networks that was already hyperexcitable due to the ma condition .
it might be useful to do more imaging studies , not only longitudinally as proposed by lipton and colleagues , but also with higher field powers as most studies were done with 1.5-tesla mris with a few exceptions ( detecting grey matter alterations ) . after all , multiple sclerosis was considered a white matter disease until higher - field - power mri studies revealed cortical alterations .

Cortical Hyperexcitability
Cerebral Damage in Migraine with Aura
Conclusion
Disclosure Statement"
54	"pfeiffer syndrome ( ps ) is a rare autosomal dominant congenital disorder , originally described by pfeiffer in 1964 , and is characterized by an acrocephalic skull , regressed midface , syndactyly of hands and feet , and broad thumbs and big toes , with a wide range of variable severity ( 1 - 3 ) .
ps is known to be caused by mutations in exons iiia or iiic of the fibroblast growth factor receptor ( fgfr ) 2 or fgfr 1 gene ( 4 - 7 ) .
we report with a review of literature the first neonate in korea with ps who had bicoronal craniosynostosis , bilateral syndactyly of the fingers and toes , and broad thumbs and big toes .
a girl was delivered by spontaneous normal vaginal delivery at 38 weeks gestation after an unremarkable pregnancy .
she was 3.5 kg in weight ( 25 - 50 percentile ) , the head circumference was 33 cm ( 25 - 50 percentile ) , and the height at birth was 52 cm ( 25 - 50 percentile ) . her mother is a gravid 4 , para 3 , 40 yr - old korean woman .
the patient is the 2nd among 3 children and is the only affected child . upon birth ,
the infant demonstrated bilaterally fused coronal sutures , mild proptosis , and maxillary hypoplasia ( fig .
the soft tissues of her 2nd , 3rd and 4th fingers were fused bilaterally to the proximal portion of distal phalanx and her bilateral thumbs were broad and deviated radially ( fig .
computed tomogram ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) studies of the cranium revealed no other abnormalities except for the presence of craniosynostosis .
three - dimensional reconstruction ct showed 3-dimensional virtual images of the bilaterally fused coronal sutures ( fig .
2a ) but that the sagittal and lambdoid suture were open more than normal to compensate for the small intracranial space , and resulting overall in a brachycephalic head shape ( fig .
plain radiography of her hands and feet showed no bony fusion between the phalanges ( fig .
three - dimensional ct image of choanal air airway showed small and narrow airway of choanal space ( fig .
4 ) . she did not have any visceral abnormality upon ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and heart .
the patient had a decompressive endoscopic tunnel craniectomy at 4 weeks of age , and is planned for second surgical correction of craniosynostosis , followed by additional correction procedure for the finger and craniofacial anomalies at a later date .
the exact incidence of ps is unknown , but is expected to be 1 in every 100,000 births in the western population , and approximately 60 cases to date have been reported in the past world - wide literature ( 8 , 9 ) .
however , it is rarer in asian population : only several cases were reported in japan ( 10 , 11 ) and no reports as yet in korea .
cohen ( 12 ) in 1993 classified this syndrome into 3 clinical subtypes and suggested that these subtypes might not be classified as separate entities , even though these classifications have important diagnostic and prognostic implications .
type 2 consists of a cloverleaf skull with pfeiffer hands and feet , together with ankylosis of the elbows .
3 ps , ocular proptosis is severe , and the anterior cranial base is markedly short .
early demise is characteristic of both types 2 and 3 , which to date has been reported to occur only as sporadic cases ( 7 , 9 ) .
clinical manifestations of this patient appeared to fit into subtype 1 according to cohen 's clinical classification of ps .
the etiology for this syndrome is autosomal dominant or fresh mutations in type i conditions , and sporadic in types ii and iii .
some cases are linked to mutations at the fgfr 1 gene at chromosome 8p11.22-p12 ( 4 ) .
mutations at the fgfr2 gene , which map at chromosome 10q25-q26 , have also been reported recently ( 9 ) .
these mutations are related to the old age of parents , especially the father , because these mutations are suspected to confer a selective advantage to survival of sperm ( 13 ) .
usually , the parents are not affected and the risk for future children of that couple is minimal .
the offspring of a patient with ps have a 50 - 60% chance of inheriting the syndrome due to the dominant characteristics of this gene .
ps may involve craniosynostosis that is most often of the coronal and lambdoid , and occasionally sagittal sutures . a severe form of craniosynostosis in the ps is kleebattschdel ( cloverleaf anomaly ) .
the abnormal skull shape could result in a small intracranial volume that increases intracranial pressure , which might be commonly presented as headaches or visual changes .
some children with ps may have only one or both mid - face problems and craniosynostosis .
the most common features of the face are regressed mid - face and shallow orbits , which may be present at birth but sometimes become more evident as the childhood progresses .
underdeveloped maxillary bone of the face results in very shallow orbits and exophthalmos or proptosis .
the shallow orbits and proptosis may lead to damage of the cornea from dryness , or exposure keratosis .
maxillary hypoplasia also results in a small larynx and pharynx behind the nose and mouth .
this restricts the passage of air into the trachea and lungs and causes respiratory distress , particularly at night when snoring and snuffling can interrupt sleep .
similarly , the passage of food is restricted , and regurgitation may result in aspiration of food into the lungs .
( 14 ) in 1990 described an infant with ps in whom the trachea showed replacement of the cartilaginous rings by a solid cartilaginous plate extending the full length of the trachea and beyond the carina resulting in tracheal stenosis .
some other features commonly seen in these patients are visual disturbances related to an imbalance of the muscle that move the eyes and hearing loss due to recurrent ear infections .
vallino - napoli ( 15 ) in 1996 reviewed the audiologic and otologic features of 9 patients with ps , ranging in age from 2 to 12 yr .
seven patients had conductive hearing loss and 1 had mixed loss ; none had purely sensorineural loss .
primary ct findings were stenosis and/or atresia of the external auditory canal , hypoplasia of the middle ear cavity , and an enlarged middle ear cavity .
( 3 ) reported upper airway compromise in three of four patients with ps type 2 , and five of seven patients with ps type 3 , and cited this as the cause of death in two cases .
mccarthy et al . ( 16 ) found upper airway anomalies in 5 of 15 patients with ps of unspecified severity , and these were the primary cause of death in two patients .
congenital anomalies of the upper airway are clearly an important cause of morbidity and mortality in ps type 2 and 3 but are rare in ps type 1 ( 14 ) .
the hands and feet in ps are involved to variable degree ( 17 - 19 ) .
. patient may have mild soft tissue webbing of syndactyly between the second , third , and fourth digits of either or both hands and feet .
the digits may be short and misshapen . whilst the fusion of the fingers and toes in apert syndrome always involves fusion of the soft tissues of the second , third and fourth digits ,
this manifestation is similar with ps , but often there is fusion of the bones as well as soft tissues in apert syndrome ( 17 ) .
other anomalies in ps could include a cleft palate , choanal atresia , tracheo- and broncho - malacia , cloverleaf skull , fused vertebrae , arnold - chiari malformation , hydrocephalus , and imperforate anus .
the above case presented by authors is in accordance with type 1 ps because the infant had a craniosynostosis only of bilateral coronal suture and demonstrated broad and radially deviated bilateral thumbs and big toes that are characteristic of ps , even though she also had syndactyly of the bilateral 2nd , 3rd and 4th fingers only with soft tissue webbing .
the diagnosis of the apert syndrome is appropriate rather than ps if a patient has broad thumbs and syndactyly with bony fusion ( 17 ) or syndactyly of the second , third and fourth web spaces ( 19 ) .
however , clinical differential diagnosis has been confusing until now in relation with genetic findings because pfeiffer mutation has been reported to occur in a patient with apert syndrome ( 20 ) , and identical mutations in the fgfr2 gene could cause both ps and crouzon syndrome phenotypes ( 21 ) as illustrated by the demonstration of both phenotypes of apert and of ps in experimental mice ( 22 ) .
some authors have attempted to revise the classification for apert , carpenter , crouzon , jackson - weiss , pfeiffer and saethre - chotzen syndromes on a genetic basis . because of widely intermingling of phenotypic expressions or genetic sharing of the same mutation , as yet there is no definite evidence that phenotypic expressions correlate accurately with genetic mutations ( 10 , 20 - 24 ) .
this is probably because the gene that controls these expressions has not been elucidated to date ( 25 ) .
the prognosis depends on the severity of associated anomalies , mainly the severity of the central nervous system compromise .
patients with types 2 and 3 usually expire early in infant or childhood even though some may survive with aggressive medical and surgical management ( 5 ) .
multiple staged surgeries are the general treatment plan for patients with ps . in the first year of life
it is preferred to release the synostotic sutures of the skull to allow adequate cranial volume and thus allowing for brain growth and expansion . in this patient
, we performed a decompressive endoscopic craniectomy at 4 weeks of age for decompression of the high intracranial pressure due to coronal synostosis and maxillary hypoplasia .
secondary decompressive skull remodeling is planned at 4 - 6 months of age , and additional skull expansion surgery would be repeated as the child grows to about 2 or 3 yr of age .
although significant malformation of the fingers and toes are present , usually these function adequately and do not require the surgical correction .
however , this patient had soft tissue webbing between the fingers and toes , and thus will require surgical dividing procedure after infancy for future active physical therapy .
mid - facial advancement may be performed in order to provide an adequate orbital volume and reduce the exophthalmos , and to correct the dental occlusion to achieve appropriate functional position , but these procedures are not common in patients with ps .
this patient also had severe choanal hypoplasia with respiratory distress from maxillary hypoplasia that will be corrected with mid - facial advancement at 5 - 6 yr of age ."	" pfeiffer syndrome is as rare as apert syndrome in the western population . 
 this condition is very rare in the asian population and has not been previously reported in korea . 
 the authors report with a review of literature the case of a newborn baby with pfeiffer syndrome , manifested by bicoronal craniosynostosis , broad thumbs , and big toes . 
 the infant also had bilateral syndactyly of the fingers and toes , mild proptosis , choanal hypoplasia and maxillary hypoplasia . "	"INTRODUCTION
CASE REPORT
DISCUSSION"
55	"diabetes mellitus is a growing public health concern , presently affecting 25.8 million or 8.3% of the american population   and nearly 387 million people worldwide .
while the availability of novel drugs , techniques , and surgical intervention has improved the survival rate of individuals with diabetes , the prevalence of diabetes is still rising in the united states , with the number of people with diabetes projected to double by 2025 .
t2d is a result of chronic insulin resistance and loss of -cell mass and function .
both in experimental animals and people , obesity is a leading pathogenic factor for developing insulin resistance , which is always associated with the impairment in energy metabolism , causing increased intracellular fat content in skeletal muscle , liver , fat , and pancreatic islets .
constant insulin resistance will progress to t2d when -cells are unable to secrete adequate amount of insulin to compensate for decreased insulin sensitivity , which is largely due to insulin secretory dysfunction and significant loss of functional -cells [ 48 ] .
indeed , those individuals with t2d always manifest increased -cell apoptosis and reduced -cell mass [ 6 , 7 , 9 ] . as such , the search for novel agents that simultaneously promote insulin sensitivity and -cell survival may provide a more effective strategy to prevent the onset of diabetes .
recently , naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds have been the focal point of medicinal research interest due to their pharmacological implications associated with human disease with considerable attention devoted to managing diabetes [ 11 , 12 ] .
polyphenols exist naturally as secondary plant metabolites and are the largest source of human dietary antioxidants , with a typical daily intake of roughly 1  g / day .
kaempferol ( 3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4h-1-benzopyran-4-one ) is a flavonol , of low molecular weight ( 286.2  g / mol ) , that has been identified in many plants used in traditional medicine , including equisetum spp .
, sophora japonica , and ginkgo biloba , and edible plants , including beans , broccoli , cabbage , gooseberries , grapes , kale , strawberries , tea , and tomatoes [ 15 , 16 ]
. dietary intake of kaempferol containing foods has been epidemiologically associated with a reduced risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases .
it has been reported that kaempferol has antioxidative , antimicrobial , anti - inflammatory , lipolytic , and anticancer [ 20 , 21 ] effects . however , to date , the studies regarding its effect on the pathogenesis of diabetes are very limited .
we recently demonstrated that kaempferol treatment prevented apoptosis and improved insulin biosynthesis and secretion in -cells and human islets exposed to chronic hyperlipidemia .
past studies have established that sustained hyperlipidemia in obese individuals plays an important role in causing -cell apoptosis and dysfunction , thereby contributing to the deterioration of glycemic control and the overt development of t2d [ 2224 ] .
this study was conducted to investigate whether long - term dietary intake of kaempferol can promote metabolic homeostasis and thereby prevent diabetic pathogenesis .
we show here that dietary intake of kaempferol for 5 months ( mo ) improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerances , which were associated with increased glut4 and ampk expression in muscle and adipose tissues in middle - aged mice fed a high - fat ( hf ) diet . in vitro , kaempferol increased lipolysis and restored chronic high fatty acid - impaired glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle cells , which were associated with improved ampk activity and glut4 expression .
in addition , dietary kaempferol treatment preserved functional pancreatic -cell mass and prevented hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance in stz - induced diabetic mice .
male ( 10-month - old ) c57bl/6j mice ( nci , nih ) were individually housed in an animal room maintained on a 12-hour light / dark cycle under constant temperature ( 2225c ) with ad libitum access to food and water .
after 1  week of environment acclimation , we conducted the following two animal studies . the institutional animal care and use committee at virginia tech approved the animal study protocols .
mice were divided into 4 groups ( n = 12 mice / group ) with blood glucose and body weight balanced and then fed a standard chow ( sd ) diet , with 10% of calories derived from fat , a hf diet ( research diets inc . ,
new brunswick , nj ) with 58% of calories from fat , or hf diet supplemented with kaempferol ( 0.01% or 0.05% ) for  5  mo . body weight and food intake were recorded weekly throughout the study . to assess fasting blood glucose ,
mice were fasted for 12  h , and blood glucose was measured in tail vein blood samples using a glucometer ( kroger , cincinnati , oh ) . after 5  mo of dietary treatment , body composition was evaluated using an lf-90 instrument ( bruker optics , inc . ,
the lf-90 body composition instrument is based on time domain nuclear magnetic resonance ( td - nmr ) technology , which provides an in vivo measurement of lean tissue , body fat , and body fluid in live mice without anesthesia . following this procedure ,
glucose and insulin tolerance tests were performed . for the glucose tolerance tests ( gtt )
, mice were fasted for 12  h and injected intraperitoneally ( ip ) with a single bolus of glucose ( 2  g / kg bw ) .
glucose levels were measured at time points of 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , and 120  min after glucose administration . for the insulin tolerance tests ( itt ) ,
mice were injected ip with insulin ( 0.75 units / kg bw ) , and blood glucose levels were measured at 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 , and 120  min after insulin administration .
area under the curve ( auc ) was calculated using the trapezoidal rule . at the end of the study ,
the mice were fasted overnight and euthanized , immediately followed by the collection of blood samples .
fasting plasma total cholesterol , hdl - cholesterol , and triacylglycerol were measured by enzymatic methods using a pointer 180 analyzer ( pointe scientific , canton , mi ) as described previously .
plasma insulin levels were measured using a mouse insulin elisa kit ( mercodia , inc . ,
blood hba1c levels were determined using an assay kit ( henry schein , inc . ,
mice were sacrificed and extensor digitorum longus muscle and abdominal adipose tissues were collected , snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen , and then stored at 80c for the western blot analyses . in a separate experiment , mice were divided into 3 groups ( n = 8 mice / group ) and fed a sd diet or sd diet containing kaempferol ( 0.01% or 0.05% ) for 3  mo .
fasting and nonfasting blood glucose levels were measured biweekly . at the end of 3  mo , gtt and itt
10-month - old male mice ( nci , nih ) were divided into 3 groups ( n = 10 mice / group ) with initial fasting blood glucose and body weights balanced among groups .
mice were then fed a sd diet , a hf diet ( 58  kcal% fat ) , or hf diet containing 0.05% kaempferol .
after 6  weeks of dietary kaempferol supplementation , gtt , itt , and body composition were evaluated as described above .
after this procedure , mice received ip injections of stz dissolved in 0.1  m cold sterile sodium citrate buffer ( ph 4.5 ) at 45  mg / kg daily for 3 consecutive days .
body weight , food intake , and nonfasting and fasting blood glucose were measured biweekly throughout the study .
, mice were euthanized , and the pancreata were dissected , weighed , and then fixed in 4% ( vol / vol ) formaldehyde buffer ( ph 7.2 ) .
a series of tissue sections ( 5  m thickness at 200  m interval ) were prepared , mounted on glass slides , and immunofluorescently stained with an insulin antibody and fitc - conjugated secondary antibody ( abcam , cambridge , ma ) for determining -cell mass .
pancreatic -cell mass was calculated by dividing the area of insulin - positive cells by the total area of pancreatic tissue and multiplied by the pancreas weight [ 25 , 26 ] .
insulin was then extracted from pancreas homogenates with acid - ethanol [ 75% ethanol , 25% acetic acid ( 25%  vol / vol ) ] overnight at 4c .
the homogenates were centrifuged ( 10  min , 2,000  g , 4c ) and the supernatants were neutralized with tris buffer .
pancreatic insulin content was measured by elisa and then normalized to the protein concentration in the same sample .
the c2c12 mouse cells ( american type culture collection , manassas , va ) were grown at 37c and 5% co2 in dulbecco 's modified eagle 's medium ( dmem ) , supplemented with penicillin ( 50  iu / ml ) , streptomycin ( 50  g / ml ) , and 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) .
the cells were grown to 75% confluence and the growth medium was then switched to dmem supplemented with 2% horse serum and penicillin ( 50  iu / ml ) and streptomycin ( 50  g / ml ) for differentiation .
c2c12 myoblasts were grown to ~80% confluence in dmem and then differentiated for 5 days in dmem supplemented with 2% horse serum . on day 5 , the myotubes were treated for 24  h with 10  m kaempferol or vehicle ( dmso ) along with a mixture of fatty acids or vehicle ( bsa ) .
the fatty acid mixture contained a 2  :  1 ratio of palmitate to oleate for a final concentration of 0.4  mm complexed with 0.4% bsa in serum - free , low glucose dmem .
following the fatty acid and kaempferol treatment , glucose uptake was assessed in krebs - ringer hepes buffer ( in mm : 136 nacl , 4.7 kcl , 1.25 mgso4 , 1.2 cacl , and 20 hepes , ph 7.4 ) with the addition of 10  m 2-deoxyglucose and 1.25  uci / ml 2-deoxy-[3h]glucose .
after 15  min of incubation , plates were placed on ice , washed three times with ice - cold pbs , and harvested in 400  l of 0.2  m naoh for cell lysis .
c2c12 myotubes were treated for 24  h with 10  m kaempferol or vehicle ( dmso ) along with 0.4  mm fatty acid ( fa ) cocktail or bsa as stated above .
after 24  h with fa and kaempferol treatment , cells were further incubated with 1.25  uci / mlc glucose ( american radiolabeled chemicals , saint louis , mo ) in the presence or absence of insulin ( 100  nm ;
eli lilly , indianapolis , in ) for 3  h. following this treatment , cells were rinsed twice with pbs at 4c followed by solubilization by adding 250  l of 30% koh .
the samples were then mixed with 35  l of 60  mg / ml glycogen ( sigma - aldrich , st .
louis , mo ) in distilled water and heated at 80c for 20  min .
following centrifugation at 4c ( 10,000  rpm ) for 20  min , the pellet was collected and washed with 70% ethanol and then resuspended in 500  l distilled water .
after 20  min of shaking , the glycogen precipitate was counted for the presence of c by liquid scintillation ( ls 6500 , beckman coulter , brea , ca ) .
glycogen synthesis was calculated based on specific activity and was expressed relative to protein content .
c2c12 muscle cells were preincubated with kaempferol or vehicle ( dmso ) for 30  min followed by addition of 20  mm glucose and 0.5  mm palmitate for 24  h. glycerol released into the medium was then measured by using a free glycerol determination kit ( sigma - aldrich , st .
animal tissues or cultured cells were homogenized in lysis buffer ( 50  mm hepes , 0.1%  ( v / v ) triton x-100 , 1  mm pmsf , 10  mm e-64 , 10  mm pepstatin a , 10  mm tlck , 100  mm leupeptin , ph 7.4 ) .
supernatants of cultured muscle cell or mouse tissue lysates were collected , and protein content was measured using an assay kit .
equal amounts of protein extracts from mouse tissues or cells were subjected to western blot analysis as described previously .
nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antibody against glut4 , ampk , or phospho - ampk ( cell signaling , danvers , ma ) .
the immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence ( thermo fischer , rockford , il ) .
nitrocellulose membranes were then stripped and reprobed with -actin ( animal tissues ) or ampk ( culture cells ) .
the protein bands were digitally imaged for densitometric quantitation with a software program ( image j , nih ) .
all proteins levels were normalized to those of -actin or total ampk , where applicable , from the same samples .
data were analyzed with one - way anova , using sigmaplot software program , and are expressed as mean  standard error ( se ) or mean  standard error of mean ( sem ) , where applicable .
in this study , we tested the metabolic effects of the long - term dietary supplementation of kaempferol ( 0.01% or 0.05% in the diet ) in middle - aged mice fed a hf diet .
the hf diet decreased the accumulative average food intake , but kaempferol supplementation for 5  mo did not alter the food consumption compared with hf diet - fed mice ( figure 1(a ) ) .
however , dietary intake of 0.05% kaempferol significantly ameliorated hf diet - induced body weight gain ( figure 1(b ) ) .
consistently , mice fed the hf diet developed obesity as determined by measuring their relative percentage of fat ( figure 1(c ) ) and muscle mass ( figure 1(d ) ) .
however , kaempferol treatment had no significant effect on adiposity of obese mice . fasting blood levels of cholesterol ( figure 1(e ) ) , ldl - cholesterol ( figure 1(f ) ) , and triglyceride ( figure 1(g ) ) were increased in hf diet - fed obese mice , which were significantly reduced by dietary intake of kaempferol . however , total cholesterol levels in kaempferol - fed mice were still significantly higher as compared to chow diet - fed mice .
fasting plasma hdl - cholesterol concentrations were increased by hf feeding but were not further altered by kaempferol treatment ( figure 1(h ) ) . in another study to determine whether kaempferol also improves metabolism and health of sd diet - fed older adult mice , we found that dietary intake of either 0.01% kaempferol ( k1 ) or 0.05% kaempferol ( k2 ) for 3  mo had no effects on body weight gain ( 5.9  0.5 , 6.1  0.4 , and 6.0  0.6  g for control , k1 , and k2 group , resp . ) , food intake ( 4.25 , 4.27 , and 4.23  g / d / mouse ) , fasting ( 136.4  4.1 , 131.6  3.4 , and 127.9  5.8  mg / dl ) and nonfasting ( 185.4  11.1 , 180.5  5.5 , and 174.4  12.2 ) blood glucose levels , glucose tolerance ( 32672  1653 , 31411  1582 , and 31078  1634 auc ) , and insulin sensitivity ( 11073  1065 , 10897  9887 , and 10574  1141 auc ) .
after 2  mo of hf diet consumption , mice displayed hyperglycemia throughout this study , as shown by persistently over 50% higher circulating glucose levels as compared with mice that consumed the sd diet .
kaempferol supplementation at this point nonsignificantly reduced the hf diet - induced rise in blood glucose .
after 3  mo , however , mice fed hf diet supplemented with kaempferol exhibited significantly lower blood glucose levels than those in hf - fed mice ; after 5  mo of treatment , mice fed kaempferol - supplemented diet still had significantly lower blood glucose levels ( 140  10.5  mg / dl ) as compared to hf diet - fed mice ( 197  10.5  mg / dl ) , which were almost reduced to the levels shown in sd - fed mice ( 123.0  4.8  mg / dl ) ( figure 2(a ) ) .
data showed that kaempferol ( 0.05% in the diet ) nonsignificantly improved glucose tolerance as demonstrated by lower blood glucose levels at 30 and 60  min ( figure 2(b ) ) as well as reduced auc ( figure 2(c ) ) following ip glucose injection compared to hf - fed mice .
consistently , blood levels of hba1c , which reflect an average of blood glucose over a period of two to three mo , were significantly lower in kaempferol - treated mice as compared to those in hf diet - fed mice ( figure 2(d ) ) .
insulin resistance is important to the etiology of t2d and usually occurs in obesity . to determine if dietary intake of kaempferol improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice , we performed an ip itt .
however , dietary provision of kaempferol as low as 0.01% significantly improved plasma glucose levels ( figure 2(e ) ) and the auc ( figure 2(f ) ) postinsulin injection in hf diet - fed mice , suggesting that kaempferol increases insulin sensitivity .
we observed that fasting plasma insulin levels in hf mice were about 6-fold of those in mice that received the sd diet , suggesting that obese mice are insulin resistant ( figure 2(g ) ) .
however , plasma insulin levels in 0.05% kaempferol - treated mice were more than 50% lower as compared with hf - fed obese mice ( figure 2(g ) )
. these data strongly suggest that long - term kaempferol supplementation maintained whole body insulin sensitivity in hf diet - induced obese mice .
insulin resistance in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle , the primary site of glucose and fatty acid utilization , plays a major role in the development of hf diet - induced t2d . to further determine the molecular events that are associated with improved insulin sensitivity by kaempferol treatment , we measured the expression of ampk and glut4 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues , which are two critical molecules regulating glucose uptake [ 30 , 31 ] .
consistent with impaired peripheral insulin sensitivity , the expression of ampk and glut4 proteins in both skeletal muscle ( figures 3(a)3(c ) ) and adipose tissue ( figures 3(d)3(f ) ) from hf diet - fed mice was significantly attenuated as compared to the control mice . however , treatment with kaempferol completely reversed these detrimental effects caused by feeding the mice with hf diet ( figures 3(a)3(f ) ) .
these results further confirmed that long - term intake of kaempferol protects against developing insulin resistance in hf diet - induced obese mice .
as skeletal muscle is the major site for fuel metabolism , and obesity and insulin resistance are always accompanied with the impairment in energy metabolism , a leading pathogenic factor for t2d , we performed a series of in vitro assays to determine whether kaempferol has direct beneficial effects on glucose metabolism . in that regard , we cultured skeletal muscle cells with or without kaempferol in the presence of palmitate and oleic acid .
we found that exposure of c2c12 myotubes to high fatty acids for 24  h impaired insulin - induced glucose uptake ( figure 4(a ) ) and glycogen synthesis ( figure 4(b ) ) .
however , these detrimental effects were partially reversed by treatment with 10  m kaempferol ( figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) ) . to further characterize metabolic and insulin sensitizing effects of kaempferol
, we cultured skeletal muscle cells with or without kaempferol in the presence of high glucose ( 20  mm ) and saturated fatty acid palmitate ( 0.5  mm ) , an in vitro environment that is frequently used to simulate diabetic condition in vivo .
the results showed that kaempferol at physiologically relevant concentrations significantly improved lipolysis ( figure 5(a ) ) and reversed high fatty acid - impaired ampk activity ( figure 5(b ) ) and glut4 protein expression ( figure 5(c ) ) , a downstream target of activated ampk . while peripheral insulin resistance is common during obesity in rodents and people , its progression to t2d is largely due to insulin secretory dysfunction and significant apoptosis of functional -cells [ 48 ] , leading to an inability to compensate for insulin resistance .
past studies have established that sustained hyperlipidemia in obese individuals plays an important role in causing -cell apoptosis and dysfunction , thereby contributing to the deterioration of glycemic control and the overt development of t2d [ 2224 ] .
we recently found that kaempferol treatment prevented apoptosis of cultured pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic hyperlipidemic condition .
we therefore further assessed whether kaempferol can also protect pancreatic -cell function , thereby preventing diabetes by using a t2d mouse model that was generated through a combination of hf diet feeding and three consecutive injections of low doses of stz . regarding this , c57bl/6 mice ( male , 10-month - old ) were fed a sd diet , a hf diet , or hf diet containing 0.05% kaempferol .
consistent with the observations from the animal study described above , treatment with kaempferol for 6  weeks had no effect on body weight gain , food intake , fasting blood glucose levels , glucose intolerance , or insulin resistance of mice fed the hf diet ( data not shown ) .
after 6  weeks of dietary treatment , stz ( 40  mg / kg bw ) was administrated ( ip ) for 3 consecutive days to induce diabetes mediated by a destruction of islet -cells in mice .
our data showed that dietary ingestion of kaempferol significantly mitigated stz - induced hyperglycemia in diabetic mice as determined by measuring fasting ( figure 6(a ) ) and nonfasting ( figure 6(b ) ) blood glucose levels . consistently , kaempferol ameliorated the loss of body weight secondary to the development of diabetes   ( data not shown ) . to determine
if the improved glycemic control in mice fed the kaempferol - supplemented diet is the result of preserved islet function , we measured insulin levels in the plasma of the control and kaempferol - fed mice .
as shown in figure 6(c ) , plasma insulin levels in mice fed diet containing kaempferol were significantly greater as compared to those in nontreated diabetic mice , suggesting that kaempferol may ameliorate hyperglycemia primarily via preserving islet -cell function .
since stz causes diabetes by destroying islet -cells , we then examined whether kaempferol treatment preserved -cell mass in diabetic mice by using an immunohistochemical technique .
we observed that hf diet - fed mice exhibited greater pancreas weight as compared with the control mice ( figure 7(a ) ) , which was not modulated by kaempferol supplementation ( figure 7(a ) ) .
however , stz administration caused severe destruction of pancreatic -cells as determined by evaluating the area of insulin positive cells ( figure 7(b ) ) and islet mass ( figure 7(c ) ) , which consequently led to the reduction of pancreatic insulin content by nearly 80% ( figure 7(d ) ) .
however , dietary provision of kaempferol partially preserved islet -cell mass ( figures 7(b ) and 7(c ) ) and insulin content ( figure 7(d ) ) in diabetic mice .
it has been reported that kaempferol elicits a number of health benefits , including antioxidative [ 17 , 37 ] , anti - inflammatory [ 18 , 38 ] , antihypertensive [ 39 , 40 ] , lipolytic [ 19 , 41 ] , and anticarcinogenic effects [ 20 , 21 , 42 ] .
however , studies on whether this compound possesses antidiabetic properties are very limited . in this study , we tested the antidiabetic potential of this natural compound by using two mouse models and in vitro studies .
it is worthy to note that , unlike many metabolic studies that used young adult mice , we used near middle - aged mice , which may be more clinically relevant , as t2d in humans often occurs during middle and late ages .
we provide evidence that long - term dietary intake of kaempferol promoted metabolic homeostasis with the improved fasting blood glucose , hba1c levels , insulin sensitivity , and glucose tolerance in hf diet - induced obese mice , which was associated with increased fuel metabolism , ampk activity , and glut4 expression in skeletal muscle cells .
further , dietary kaempferol also ameliorates hyperglycemia in stz - induced diabetic mice by preserving functional -cell mass .
importantly , these beneficial metabolic effects , elicited by dietary intake of kaempferol , are not due to alteration in food intake . given that both insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and progressive -cell loss and dysfunction are key components in the pathogenesis of t2d [ 48 ] , kaempferol could be a low - cost and safe natural compound to promote energy metabolism and maintain glucose homeostasis by targeting these two defects .
it is well established that obesity is an important risk factor for t2d [ 43 , 44 ] .
therefore , hf diets are commonly used as a strategy to induce obesity in animal models , leading to the development of metabolic disorders including hyperlipidemia , impaired insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance , and elevated blood insulin and glucose [ 4548 ] .
consistently , our data showed that consumption of the hf diet induced obesity and elevated plasma concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol that are typical of obesity , which however were ameliorated in mice fed a hf diet containing kaempferol . given that obesity is a leading pathogenic factor for developing insulin resistance and subsequent glucose intolerance
, the improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis by kaempferol supplementation could be partially due to the secondary effects whereby long - term intake of kaempferol ameliorated obesity in mice fed a hf diet . while it is presently unclear how kaempferol affects lipid metabolism and body weight gain , previous studies demonstrated that several structurally similar flavonoids inhibit lipid absorption and lipogenesis [ 5052 ] . because food intake was not affected by long - term kaempferol supplementation , the decrease in fasting plasma cholesterol and triglycerides in the hf - fed mice could be caused by the regulation of the intestinal digestion and absorption of lipids and/or lipogenesis , which needs further investigation .
as kaempferol treatment did not alter calorie intake in mice during the course of this study , it is also possible that the reduced body fat mass as well as body weight in kaempferol - fed mice is due to its effect on energy expenditure , given that obesity results from energy imbalance .
several lines of evidence have shown that pharmacological activation of ampk improves blood glucose homeostasis and lipid profile in insulin - resistant rodents .
ampk is an energy sensing molecule highly conserved from yeast to all animals , which is increasingly recognized as a master regulator of whole body energy homeostasis .
ampk is a heterotrimeric protein kinase composed of a catalytic subunit ( ampk ) and two regulatory subunits (  and  ) that sense low cellular energy levels by monitoring changes in the amp  :  atp ratio .
amp binding to the  subunit induces a conformational change that allows ampk to be phosphorylated at its threonine residue ( thr 172 ) by the ampk - activating protein kinase ( lkb1 ) . at the whole body level
, ampk integrates stress responses , nutrient and hormonal signals to the control of food intake , energy expenditure , and substrate utilization . at the cellular level ,
activated ampk inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis , promotes fatty acid oxidation , and regulates mitochondrial biogenesis .
in addition , activation of ampk increases glut4 expression and membrane translocation in skeletal muscle , thereby improving glucose uptake .
consistent with the impaired insulin sensitivity in hf - fed obese mice , we found that the protein levels of ampk and glut4 in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue from these animals were also considerably attenuated .
however , these detrimental effects were completely reversed by supplementation of 0.05% kaempferol in the hf diet .
these results suggest that kaempferol may increase peripheral insulin sensitivity via the ampk - mediated pathway .
both in experimental animals and people , obesity - related insulin resistance is always associated with the dysfunctions of several metabolic pathways including reduced lipolysis , fatty acid oxidation , glucose uptake , and glycogen synthesis coupled with increased glucose output .
specifically , it is believed that elevated intramyocellular lipid accumulation coupled with diminished lipolysis and mitochondrial lipid oxidation play a role in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle .
consistently , it was found that inducing lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation in muscle cells protects against lipotoxicity - induced insulin resistance [ 58 , 59 ] . in the present study
, we further showed that kaempferol treatment as low as 1  m augmented lipolysis and reversed chronic hyperlipidemia - impaired glucose uptake , glut4 expression , ampk activity , and glycogenesis in skeletal muscle cells , which provides further evidence at cellular levels that kaempferol might be an insulin sensitizing molecule by promoting energy metabolism .
however , it is presently unclear how kaempferol exerts these beneficial effects in skeletal muscle cells .
kaempferol has been shown to possess antioxidant property . while we found that pharmacological doses of kaempferol ( 1050  m ) showed significant free radical scavenging activity as evaluated by using an oxygen radical absorbance assay , it had no such effect at 1  m
. therefore , kaempferol promotion of skeletal muscle cell function may not be due to its potential antioxidant effect .
we further explored whether kaempferol directly protects pancreatic -cell function in vivo by using a nongenetic mouse model of t2d , which was generated by employing a combination of feeding a hf diet and administering three mild doses ( 40  mg / kg ) of stz that does not cause diabetes in chow - fed mice , as demonstrated in our recent study .
this nongenetic diabetic mouse model manifests the metabolic characteristics of human t2d , including moderate levels of hyperglycemia , hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance , impaired insulin secretion , and reduced -cell mass .
the results in the present study show that kaempferol partially preserved -cell mass in stz - induced diabetic mice , which could be primarily attributable to its antidiabetic action , given that diabetes was induced before kaempferol caused changes in body weight , adiposity , or other metabolic parameters .
we speculate that kaempferol treatment may protect against -cell apoptosis , thereby improving islet mass , given our recent observations that kaempferol promotes viability of isolated pancreatic islets exposed to chronic hyperglycemia   or hyperlipidemia . in summary , we provide evidence that long - term dietary supplementation of kaempferol prevents hf diet - induced metabolic disorders in middle - aged obese mice . on cellular and molecular levels
, kaempferol improves glycolysis , glucose uptake , glycogen synthesis , ampk activity , and glut4 expression in skeletal muscle .
in addition , dietary supplementation of kaempferol significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia and preserved functional islet mass in old adult obese diabetic mice .
these results indicate that phytonutrient kaempferol may be used as a dietary supplement to prevent metabolic disorders that are associated with obesity and aging ."	" insulin resistance and a progressive decline in functional -cell mass are hallmarks of developing type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) . 
 thus , searching for natural , low - cost compounds to target these two defects could be a promising strategy to prevent the pathogenesis of t2d . here 
 , we show that dietary intake of flavonol kaempferol ( 0.05% in the diet ) significantly ameliorated hyperglycemia , hyperinsulinemia , and circulating lipid profile , which were associated with the improved peripheral insulin sensitivity in middle - aged obese mice fed a high - fat ( hf ) diet . 
 kaempferol treatment reversed hf diet impaired glucose transport-4 ( glut4 ) and amp - dependent protein kinase ( ampk ) expression in both muscle and adipose tissues from obese mice . in vitro , kaempferol increased lipolysis and prevented high fatty acid - impaired glucose uptake , glycogen synthesis , ampk activity , and glut4 expression in skeletal muscle cells . using another mouse model of t2d generated by hf diet feeding and low doses of streptozotocin injection , we found that kaempferol treatment significantly improved hyperglycemia , glucose tolerance , and blood insulin levels in obese diabetic mice , which are associated with the improved islet -cell mass . 
 these results demonstrate that kaempferol may be a naturally occurring anti - diabetic agent by improving peripheral insulin sensitivity and protecting against pancreatic -cell dysfunction . "	"1. Introduction

56	"adenomatous hyperplasia of gallbladder is the most common benign mesenchymal proliferation , accounting for more than 40% of tumor - like lesions of the organ .
malignant mesenchymal neoplasms of the gallbladder are extremely rare and only 105 isolated cases of primary gallbladder sarcoma have been reported .
a variety of tumor types have been reported ( such as leiomayosarcoma , rhadomyosarcom , angiosarcoma , kaposi 's sarcoma , malignant fibrous histiocytoma , and synovial sarcoma ) .
leiomyosarcomas are usually diagnosed at an advanced stage therefore surgical management is not a therapeutic option .
consensus about the management of leiomyosarcomas is limited due to limited experience with to this type of tumor .
we present a case of leiomyosarcoma of the gallbladder treated by radical cholecystectomy and small bowel resection .
a 54-year - old male patient presented to the outpatient clinic with complaints of a palpable mass in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen , nausea and some weight loss . on physical examination , a firm and fixed mass was found in the abdomen .
the tumor markers ( carcinoembyonic antigen , carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 , alpha - fetoprotein ) were also normal .
endoscopic ultrasound examination revealed a gallbladder mass without direct invasion of liver parenchyma and duodenum ( fig .
1 ) . abdominal computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( mrcp ) demonstrated a 9-cm mass lesion that was attached to the small bowel and abdominal wall , but had not invaded the liver parenchyma ( figs . 2 , 3 ) .
the stage of tumor using the standard tumor - node - metastasis staging system was t4n0m0 .
the 18f - fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography / ct that was performed to check for distal metastasis revealed a hypermetabolic lesion ( maximum standardized uptake value [ suvmax ] 14.5 ) in the entire gallbladder ( fig .
we performed a simultaneous radical cholecystectomy ( s4b + s5 segmentectomy ) , omentectomyand small bowel segmental resection .
we also did dissection of lymph nodes around the hepatoduodenal ligaments and the celiac trunk .
histopathology showed a malignant spindle cell tumor consisting of leiomyosarcoma with marked nuclear atypia and mitosis ( 62/10 high - power fields [ hpfs ] ) ( fig .
the neoplastic cells infiltrated the muscularispropia layers of the small bowel and the soft tissue of the abdominal wall .
the tumor cells showed positive immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin ( sma ) ( fig .
there was negative immunoreativities for the following markers ; caldesmon , cytokeratin ( ck ) 7 , ck19 , ck20 , cd31 , cd34 , c - kit , calponin , desmin , myoglobin , hmb45 , high molecular weight cytokeratin ( hmwck ) , panck , and s100 .
a pulmonary thromboemolism in the upper left anterior lobe 's segmental branch was revealed in a chest ct therefore , the patients received thrombolysis followed by heparin anticoagulation therapy .
multiple liver metastasis and seeding metasitasis on the peritoneum were found in an abdominal ct 1 month postoperatively .
the patient subsequently underwent adjuvant chemotherapy composed of mesna , adriamycin , ifosfamide and dacarbazine ( maid ) for 3 months .
sarcomas of the gallbladder are rare and represent about 1.5% of all malignant gallbladder diseases .
a variety of tumor types have been described including leiomyosarcoma , rhabdomyosarcoma , angiomyosarcoma , kaposi 's sarcoma , malignant fibrous histiyocytoma , and synovial sarcoma .
leiomyosarcoma of the gallbladder is an especially rare malignant tumor . by 1984 , 105 cases of primary sarcomas of the gallbladder had been reported , with primary leiomyosarcomas accounting for 7% of them .
the diagnoses were established in accordance with the new world health organization classifications for soft tissue tumors and the most recent soft tissue criteria published .
leiomyosarcoma is defined as a malignant tumor composed of cells showing distinct smooth muscle features . in the macroscopy ,
leiomyosarcoma typically forms a fleshy mass , with colors varying from grey to white to tan .
the typical histopathologic pattern of leiomyosarcoma is that of intersecting , sharply marginated groups of spindle cells . in the immunophenotype , desmin , h - caldesmon , and sma
none of these are absolutely specific to smooth muscle and positivity for two of these markers were more supportive of leiomyosarcoma than positivity for one alone .
immunostains may be focally positive on cd34 , epithelial membrane antigen ( ema ) , keratin and s100 .
a diagnosis should be made on the appropriate morphologic features , not only on the immunostains . in this case , immunopositive staining was strong for sma and vimentin but the typical histopathologic pattern of leiomyosarcoma had appeared in the hematoxylin and eosin stain .
leiomyosarcoma is more frequent in women between the ages of 50 and 75 years and usually has a poor prognosis .
the presence of gallstones are invariable and the symptoms presented are those of chronic cholecystitis .
histopathologically , the majority of these tumors are - high grade and display an epithelioid morphology ; but cases with features of well - differentiated leiomyosarcoma have been described . according to the national comprehensive cancer network clinical practice guideline in oncology ver .
i. 2011 , patients with a resectable intraabdominal sarcoma should undergo immediate surgical treatment with a grossly negative margin and and possible interoperative radiation therapy .
the postoperative margin status was the most important factor contributing to long - term disease free survival .
postoperative treatment options were dependent on the surgical outcomes and clinical , or pathological finding following surgery .
postoperative radiation therapy should be considered in patients with pathological findings of high grade disease following a negative margin resection ( r0 resection ) or for microscopic positive margins ( r1 resection ) .
for patients with unresectable or disseminated recurrences , preoperative rt and/or chemotherapy should be considered after a biopsy .
combination regimens with activity in soft tissue sarcoma include ad ( doxorubicin , dacarbazine ) , aim ( doxorubicin , ifosfamide , mesna ) , maid , and so on .
the single agents include dacarbazine , doxorubicin , epirubicin , gemcitabine , ifosfamide , liposomal doxorubicin and temozolomide .
the prognosis of sarcoma and leiomyosarcomas of the gallbladder is dismal , the five year survival rate being less than 5% .
this is due to the fact that at the time of the diagnosis or surgery .
our patient was also diagnosed at an advanced stage , but he had no distant organ metastasis . because r0 resection is expected in this case , an aggressive surgical approach was attempted .
however , soon after , multiple liver metastasis and peritoneal seeding metastasis were detected in postoperative evaluations . therefore additional aggressive multimodality treatments such as surgery with chemotherapy are the only way to increase the survival rate . in conclusion , the five year survival rate of leiomyosarcoas of the gallbladder is less than 5% .
however for young and healthy patients with leiomyosarcomas of the gallbladder , aggressive surgical treatment followed by adjuvant chemotherapy should increase the survival rate despite high mortality and morbidity .
further studies are needed to confirm the benefit of aggressive treatment for patients with leiomyosarcoma of the gallbladder .
also surgeons will have to tread very carefully in selection of candidates for surgical treatments ."	" malignant mesenchymalneoplasms of the gallbladder are extremely rare with only 105 cases of primary gallbladder sarcoma having been described . 
 it has a very aggressive behavior and is usually diagnosed at advanced stages . 
 therefore , curative surgical management may not be possible . 
 we performed a radical cholecystectomy ( s4b + s5 segmentectomy ) , omentectomy and small bowel resection in a 54-year - old patient with locally invasive leiomyosarcoma of the gallbladder . 
 further studies are needed to confirm the benefit of aggressive treatment for patients with leiomyosarcoma of the gallbladder . "	"INTRODUCTION
CASE REPORT
DISCUSSION"
58	"bioinformatic tools in molecular biology can easily establish hypotheses for a directed design of experimental set - ups .
bioinformatic gene expression analysis is supported by increasing data on spatial and temporal gene expression and transcription factors ( tfs ) .
gene transcription is mainly regulated by the binding of tfs to cis - regulatory sequences .
the occurrence of a cis - sequence is the prerequisite for direct dna binding that promotes or represses transcription of the gene .
eukaryotic regulation of gene expression is complex and involves synchronized binding of tfs to adjacent cis - regulatory sequences ( 1 ) .
a colocalization analysis of tf binding sites ( tfbs ) is useful to predict such combinatorial effects on gene expression .
bioinformatic methods have been established to predict putative binding sites of tfs in dna sequences .
web - based resources for detecting tf binding sites or cis - regulatory sequences in plant genes not restricted to arabidopsis thaliana are place , plantcare , and transfac ( 24 ) .
genome - wide detection of binding sites can be performed online with the regulatory sequence analysis ( rsa ) tools ( 5 ) .
a similar genomic sequence search in arabidopsis can be performed using patmatch at tair ( 6,7 ) .
pattern recognition programs such as matinspector , match or patser utilize alignment matrices which are derived for example from random binding site selection experiments that determine a set of dna sequences that can be bound by the same factor ( 810 ) . using patser ,
this database generates a genome wide map of putative tf binding sites determined from alignment matrices ( 11 ) .
web tools have been implemented for the detection of colocalizing cis - regulatory elements in the genome ( 12 ) .
in addition to positional weight matrix - based detection of binding sites , experimentally verified binding sites were annotated as well ( 13 ) . the last version of athamap contained the genomic positions of more than 8  10 putative tfbs for 88 tfs from 21 different families .
in contrast to agris , athamap covers the whole a.thaliana genome and is mainly based on binding site detection by positional weight matrices .
co - regulation of genes may be directed by similar combinations of cis - regulatory elements . for a.thaliana , several web - based services harbour gene expression data from microarray experiments and allow recovery of co - regulated genes .
such web - based services are for example tair , nascarrays tools , stanford microarray database , botany array resource , geo , and genevestigator ( 6,1621 ) . for the detection of gene clusters with similar expression patterns , act , botany array resource , csb.db , and genevestigator can be used ( 19,2124 ) . to enable discovery and analysis of common cis - regulatory elements annotated in athamap
, a new gene analysis feature has been developed to allow comparative analysis of cis - elements in sets of co - transcribed genes .
similar expression patterns can also be determined by colocalizing tfbs . for this , the colocalization function has been improved for identification of gene sets harbouring similar combinations of tfbs .
furthermore , the data content in athamap has increased significantly and the gene structure is shown in the sequence display window .
to identify and analyze co - regulated genes for common tfbs , the gene analysis web tool has been implemented . on the gene analysis page at athamap
, a gene list can be entered by providing the locus identifier ( agi ) of each gene separated by carriage returns .
in addition to the gene list , the region of the genes to be analyzed needs to be specified as well .
therefore , the upstream and downstream borders of the analyzed regions relative to the annotated translation start point have to be entered . because all matrix - based tf binding sites have a specific score between the threshold and maximum score defined by patser , a restriction to higher conserved tfbs can be applied as well ( 12 ) . as an example for co - regulation
, the genomic region for analysis ranges from 500 bp upstream to 50 bp downstream relative to the translation start point .
a search result table lists the tf binding sites in the analyzed genomic region in detail .
it displays the gene , the name and the family of the transcription factor and the chromosomal position of its tfbs .
in addition , the distance of the binding site relative to the translation start point and the orientation of the binding site relative to the gene are specified .
a plus means that the tf binding site and the gene are in the same orientation .
furthermore , for matrix - based tfbs also the maximum score and threshold score of the screening matrix as well as the individual score of the tfbs as a measure for sequence conservation are given .
all listed genes and positions of the tfbs are linked to the sequence window for single gene display in the genomic context of surrounding binding sites . because a gene may harbour more than one binding site for a specific tf
this results in a list of all gene - factor combinations having at least one binding site .
the list shows the gene , the tf , the tf family , and the number of tfbs detected .
the number of sites located upstream and downstream as well as their relative orientation to the start point of translation are given .
this and all other tables can easily be copied and exported to a spreadsheet program for additional data processing .
orchestrated regulation of genes involves binding of specific tfs to sets of genes . by selecting  show factors that are common in genes , the occurrence of binding sites among the whole set of genes from a gene analysis search is displayed . in this table , all tfs with identified tf binding sites in the gene set are shown .
further information given is the total number of sites detected among the set of genes . to estimate tfbs frequencies ,
the theoretical number of tf binding sites in the genomic regions analyzed is also shown .
this number is based on a theoretical random distribution of the total annotated tf binding sites of the respective tf .
the ratio between real occurrence of tfbs and theoretical occurrence shows whether particular tf binding sites are over- or underrepresented .
further valuable information can be extracted by selecting  show all factors. this extends the table by showing also all tf with binding sites that are absent in the analyzed gene regions . a similar resource to inspect arabidopsis promoter sets for cis - regulatory sequences is athena ( 25 ) .
important differences between athamap and athena are the fixed promoter region of 3 kb in athena and the flexible gene region selection in athamap .
athena binding sites are based on 105 tf consensus sequences from place and agris ( 2,14 ) . in contrast , athamap is mainly based on alignment matrices of tfbs ( 11 ) .
athena has 30 tfbs in each promoter region of 3 kb ( 25 ) . in comparison
, athamap has a tf binding site density of 260 tfbs in a 3 kb region including the data update presented here . to demonstrate the functionality of the gene analysis web tool , three cold - inducible genes ( cor15a : at2g42540 , cor15b : at2g42530 , and rd29a : at5g52310 )
the genomic region analyzed was first restricted to the upstream regions ( 500 bp upstream , 0 bp downstream ) .
the distribution of binding sites among the whole set of genes can be analyzed by selecting 
show factors that are common in genes. figure 1 shows that all three genes harbour dreb1a ( cbf3 ) , dreb1b ( cbf1 ) and dreb1c ( cbf2 ) binding sites in the upstream region .
a p - value of 4.36  10 was determined for the occurence of 11 and more dreb1a binding sites within 500 bp of the upstream region of the three selected genes .
this value was determined from the total number of 552 dreb1a tfbs identified in the genome ( athamap documentation page ) , the total arabidopsis genome sequence length of 119 186 497 bp , and the total 1500 bp analysed for dreb1a binding sites .
for the 6 dreb1b and c tfbs the p - value is 6.21  10 .
it has been demonstrated , that these tfs , which are members of the ap2/erebp family , can activate cold - induced genes by binding to the dre / crt cis - acting elements present in their promoter regions ( 2729 ) .
the three sample genes are regulated by members of the ap2/erebp transcription factor family , namely cbf / drebs ( 26 ) .
only the first lines of the result table showing common binding sites in the gene set are displayed . in a further analysis of these genes , the genomic region
was restricted to 0 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream to determine whether ap2/erebp binding site overrepresentation is specific to the upstream regions . in this analysis ,
no dreb1a ( cbf3 ) , dreb1b ( cbf1 ) and dreb1c ( cbf2 ) binding sites were identified ( data not shown ) .
this indicates specific accumulation of these binding sites in the upstream region of the three genes .
this example demonstrates the application of the gene analysis function for a set of co - regulated genes .
the athamap colocalization web tool permits the positional identification of putative combinatorial elements ( 12 ) . in the earlier version of athamap ,
now , the locus ids of the closest genes of all colocalizing tf binding sites and the relative distances to the translation start sites are identified . for colocalization analysis , either a tf from the complete list of tfs
can be selected by factor name or a factor family can be choosen and one member of this family can be selected for colocalization analysis .
a denominator in front of the factor name indicates how the tf binding sites were identified . a bar (  ) precedes all tfs that were annotated by matrix - based searches ( 11 ) . a double bar ( =) is assigned to combinatorial elements ( 12 ) .
tfs with binding sites derived from experimentally verified single sites based on consensus sequences are preceded by an arrow ( > ) ( 13 ) . after a colocalization analysis , the resulting table specifies the chromosomal positions of the colocalizing binding sites and the locus i d of the nearest annotated gene .
the locus ids in this table are linked to the sequence display window showing the genomic context of the gene .
furthermore , an entire result list can easily be submitted to gene analysis for determination of further common cis - regulatory elements by using the respective link .
another link directly exports the gene list to the microarray gene expression analysis form in pathoplant for the identification of co - expression during plant - pathogen interaction ( 30 ) .
such a list of genes can also be used with other programs for co - expression analysis in microarray databases such as genevestigator ( 21 ) .

since the last update of athamap , a significant change in data display was implemented . in the earlier version , whole genes were displayed as underlined sequence stretches ( 11 ) .
now , also gene structure elements , i.e. untranslated regions ( utrs ) , exons and introns , are identified .
the annotation of gene structure is based on xml flatfiles downloaded from the tigr web site ( release 5.0 ) ( 31 ) .
these flatfiles were parsed using a perl script and positional information for 5- and 3-utrs , exons and introns were annotated to athamap .
these regions are displayed in athamap with a colour code similar to the one used by tair ( 6 ) .
forward means that the gene is encoded on the annotated and displayed dna strand , reverse means that the gene is encoded on the reverse complement strand . for further information on the respective gene ,
a short description is provided and direct links to tair , tigr , and mips records are given ( 6,31,32 ) .
the data content of athamap was increased with nine new alignment matrices derived from eight tfs , another eight tfs with single site - based binding sites and one combinatorial element .
table 1 lists the number of new tf binding sites detected with each matrix and the reference for the alignment matrix . in the case of spl3 and spl8
, the sequences for alignment matrix generation were obtained directly from the authors of the respective publication ( table 1 ) .
binding sites derived from both hox2a matrices were used for determination of combinatorial hox2a elements ( 33 ) .
athamap now contains 9  872  372 tf binding sites detected with alignment matrices , 94  963 tf binding sites detected with experimentally verified tfbs , and 359  867 combinatorial elements based on known tf interactions .
table 3 summarizes the tf families and the number of different tfs represented in athamap .
matrix - based athamap data increase number of putative binding sites detected with nine new alignment matrices for eight tfs in the a.thaliana genome .

transcription factor families represented in athamap in case of the cat and tata box binding proteins ( cbf , tbp ) , the alignment matrices were extracted from the plantprom database ( 47 ) ."	" the athamap database generates a map of cis - regulatory elements for the whole arabidopsis thaliana genome . 
 this database has been extended by new tools to identify common cis - regulatory elements in specific regions of user - provided gene sets . 
 a resulting table displays all cis - regulatory elements annotated in athamap including positional information relative to the respective gene . 
 further tables show overviews with the number of individual transcription factor binding sites ( tfbs ) present and tfbs common to the whole set of genes . over represented cis - elements 
 are easily identified . 
 these features were used to detect specific enrichment of drought - responsive elements in cold - induced genes . 
 for identification of co - regulated genes , the output table of the colocalization function was extended to show the closest genes and their relative distances to the colocalizing tfbs . 
 gene sets determined by this function can be used for a co - regulation analysis in microarray gene expression databases such as genevestigator or pathoplant .

IMPROVED SEQUENCE DISPLAY AND INCREASED DATA CONTENT"
60	"the use of visible light to examine intraocular processes can be considered the traditional form of imaging in ophthalmology .
molecular imaging permits noninvasive visualization and measurement of molecular and cell biology in living subjects , thereby complementing conventional anatomical imaging .
molecular imaging is defined as the ability to visualize and quantitatively measure the function of biological and cellular processes in vivo [ 1 , 2 ] , while anatomical imaging plays a major role in medical imaging for diagnosis , surgical guidance , and treatment monitoring , focused and personalized therapy , and earlier treatment followup .
the main advantage of in vivo molecular imaging is its ability to characterize pathologies of diseased tissues without invasive biopsies or surgical procedures , and with this information in hand , a more personalized treatment - planning regimen can be applied . 
 in vivo visualization techniques of the retinal microcirculation , including conventional fundus fluorescein angiography ( ffa ) and indocyanine green angiography ( icga ) or the experimental laser - targeted angiography [ 3 , 4 ] , are used to investigate the retinal vascular network and hemodynamic conditions .
however , these methods do not allow evaluation of leukocyte endothelial interaction in the retinal flow or identification of specific molecular changes during disease . recently
, we introduced a novel technique for detection of endothelial surface molecules in ocular inflammation . using adhesive molecule - conjugated fluorescent microspheres ( mss )   in live animals
, we showed early endothelial changes in ocular microvessels at an early stage , which were previously detectable only by the most sensitive in vitro techniques , such as immunohistochemistry or pcr . in fluorescence imaging ,
light of the excitation wavelengths must penetrate tissues to reach a targeted reporter molecule carrying a fluorochrome , resulting in the emission of light of usually lower wavelength that can be registered by a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera .
fluorescent proteins , such as cyan , green , or yellow fluorescent protein , can be introduced into cells of choice by transgenic technology . for accurate in vivo detection and measurement ,
this paper briefly describes different molecular imaging techniques and devices used in retinal imaging , as well as potential imaging tools and targets that may be translated into clinical applications in the near future .
the development of molecular imaging is rooted in radiology and nuclear medicine as well as in molecular biology . since the 1950s
, nuclear imaging of radioactive isotope - labeled biomacromolecule has been an integral part of drug development and diagnostic imaging .
the broad clinical significance of such approaches remained restricted until positron emission tomography was introduced in 1979 and became an important tool for the detection of metabolic activities in tissues such as the brain and heart , as well as in cancer .
it facilitated a biological imaging readout , albeit with limited specificity . around the same time ,
magnetic resonance spectroscopy promoted the evolution of molecular imaging . the ability to collect information about specific endogenous molecules by taking advantage of
these advances paved the way for pioneering molecular imaging studies by demonstrating in vivo imaging of reporter gene expression .
concurrently , optical bioluminescence imaging for in vivo detection of the fluc reporter gene was demonstrated .
the introduction of imaging instrumentation dedicated to small animals   and the description of enzyme - activated small - molecule probes for optical fluorescence imaging further fueled scientific interest .
recent work has focused on the extension and refinement of molecular imaging technology and its application to the diagnosis of cancer   and cardiovascular disease .
the use of visible light to examine intraocular processes can be considered the oldest form of imaging in ophthalmology .
optical molecular imaging technologies use light emitted through fluorescence or bioluminescence . in fluorescence imaging , light of the excitation wavelengths must penetrate tissues to reach a targeted reporter molecule carrying a fluorochrome , resulting in the emission of light of usually lower wavelength that can be registered by a charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera .
fluorescent proteins , such as cyan , green , or yellow fluorescent protein can be introduced into cells of choice by transgenic technology .
these animals render all cells expressing the fractalkine receptor , such as microglia cells , dendritic cells , and macrophages , intrinsically fluorescent .
certain filters , such as those used by fluorescein or indocyanine green angiography , allow the detection of specifically fluorescent structures . as in fluorescence imaging , numerous transgenic animals
have been generated that express various types of luciferase under different promoters whose expression in disease models can be measured after florescence injection .
imaging stations have been developed that allow detection of even faint light emission from within the body of experimental animals .
this method is particularly helpful when long emission wavelengths are employed , because these penetrate living tissues much better .
noninvasive time - course analyses have therefore become possible and could theoretically be of great use in ophthalmology as well as in other fields . inflammation and tracing of inflammatory cells has been a key topic in molecular imaging in recent years .
using an established model of ocular inflammation , endotoxin - induced uveitis , sun and colleagues visualized the rolling and adhesive interaction of fluorescent microspheres conjugated to recombinant p - selectin glycoprotein ligand - ig ( rpsgl - ig ) in the choriocapillaris by means of slo . in our recent work ,
we further introduce novel molecular imaging agents that target two distinct types of endothelial surface molecules , a mediator of rolling and one that mediates firm adhesion , and evaluate the success of anti - inflammatory treatment in vivo .
our imaging approach is founded on certain aspects of leukocyte - endothelial interaction , a common component in the pathogenesis of various ocular diseases .
leukocytes normally do not interact with the endothelium of blood vessels , save for occasional tethering .
however , at sites of inflammation , endothelial cells express adhesion molecules , such as p - selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( icam-1 ) which facilitate the multistep leukocyte recruitment cascade .
the steps of the recruitment process include tethering , rolling , firm adhesion , and transmigration into the extravascular space [ 7 , 19 ] .
our results show the superior sensitivity of double - conjugated mss for detection of endothelial injury , compared to mss that only target one type of endothelial markers .
our previous work showed accumulation of rpsgl-1-conjugated mss in choroidal microvessels . here , we also quantitatively compare the rolling of various mss in retinal and choroidal vessels .
the rolling flux of rpsgl-1-conjugated mss is significantly higher in eiu animals than in controls .
in contrast , the rolling flux of anti - icam-1-conjugated mss is not significantly different between eiu and control animals .
this finding is in line with the fact that cd18/icam-1 is not primarily a rolling ligand pair in vivo .
the significantly higher rolling interaction of the double - conjugated mss compared to the rpsgl-1-conjugated mss indicates that icam-1 may contribute to the rolling of the mss , once the interaction with the endothelium is initiated .
surprisingly , the rolling velocity of the double - conjugated mss is significantly higher in the choroidal vessels than in the retina . the absolute number of ms interactions in the choriocapillaris is higher than in the retina .
this difference might be explained by the higher vascular density in the choriocapillaris compared to the retina . also , the inflammatory response in the choroid may differ from retina .
another striking qualitative difference between the two vascular beds is that , in the retina , most rolling initiates from the periphery and continues toward the optic nerve head , suggesting that the rolling interaction mainly occurs in the retinal veins .
acridine orange digital fluorography revealed leucocyte rolling in the retina of animals with experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis .
retinal images were generated by an slo connected to a computer - assisted image analysis system .
acridine orange binds to dna and rna , and the spectral properties of acridine orange dna complexes are very similar to those of sodium fluorescein , with a 502  nm excitation maximum and an emission maximum of 522  nm .
results reveal that leukocyte endothelium interaction and extravascular infiltration in the retinal venous vasculature may play significant roles in the early stages of posterior segment inflammation .
xu and colleagues reported another method of investigating leucocytes in the retinal vasculature by slo .
they tried to inject calcein - acetoxymethyl ester- ( am- ) labeled t cells into the tail vein of rodents .
leucocyte dynamics can also be monitored in the iris stroma , limbus , and choroid using intravital microscopy with an epifluorescent illumination microscope equipped with a black - and - white camera connected to a video capture card .
leucocytes were stained either with rhodamine g66 or carboxy fluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester ( cfse ) to monitor the iris and limbus to visualise leucocytes in the choroid .
interleukin- ( il- ) 2 , which is expressed upon stimulation of t cells , commonly serves as t - cell activation marker .
they showed by intravital microscopy that transgenic mice expressing gfp under the control of il-2 regulatory elements can be used for in vivo expression assays that allow detection of activated t cells in the iris at multiple time points within the same animal with experimental uveitis .
intravital microscopy has also been used for imaging dendritic cells in the cornea using transgenic mice that express yfp under control of the cd11c promoter ( cd11c - yfp ) .
cslo has also been used to visualise apoptosis of single nerve cells in the retina in vivo , in order to perform longitudinal studies of disease processes such as glaucoma .
this technique enables direct observation of single nerve cell apoptosis by using alexa fluor 488-labelled annexin v and a prototype zeiss .
adaptive optics slo was used to image the retinal pigment epithelial ( rpe ) cells in patients with rod - cone dystrophy and bilateral progressive maculopathy .
 adaptive optics  denotes a set of methods for measuring and compensating for the aberration of individual eyes , consisting of trial lenses to correct sphere and cylinder , a shack - hartmann - based wave front sensor to detect residual aberration , and a deformable mirror to correct this residual aberration .
integrated into an slo , lateral resolution of 2  mm could be achieved , which enables imaging of rpe cells , cone photoreceptors , and the flow of single leucocytes and the lamina cribrosa .
choi and coworkers have integrated adaptive optics into a fundus camera for imaging cone photoreceptors in patients with retinal dystrophies and optic neuropathy .
preclinical molecular imaging in small animals is an invaluable part of new molecular targets and contrast agents , as well as developing drugs prior to clinical translation .
research shows that the time intensive and expensive preclinical steps involved in molecular target identification , validation , chemical synthesis , and characterization for new molecular imaging agents . in fact , the majority of current molecular imaging agents used in the clinic were discovered through these exhaustive preclinical experiments at academic institutions .
it is estimated that a molecular imaging agent costs about $ 150 million over 10 years to transfer to the clinic , ending with average double cost per year revenue for successful contrast agents .
to identify a molecular target beginning with understanding and characterizing the biology , the first step is to find the differences between a healthy and diseased state .
for instance , since there is an intricate relationship between cancer and inflammation ( chronic inflammation maybe promote , cancer , and cancer onset could promote an inflammatory response ) , the differences between inflammation and cancer states must be characterized .
in general , much focus is directed to cancer imaging including retinal and choroidal tumor , and several preclinical studies have identified new molecular targets for imaging cancer .
in addition to imaging the cancer phenotype such as increases in metabolism , angiogenesis , proliferation , hypoxia , and apoptosis , agents have been developed to target specific protein markers expressed on cancer cells .
many chemotherapeutic drugs also target these markers ; they have been radiolabelled for assessment of biodistribution and pharmacokinetics using noninvasive molecular imaging .
continuing preclinical research has exploded not only in molecular target discovery and imaging probe developments but also in new strategies for imaging methodologies , especially in the areas of optical imaging . with the advent of new ,
smaller instruments / devices for insertion into the body , molecular imaging strategies with optical devices and specific molecular - targeted contrast agents have great potential for translation into the clinic , which is reviewed in the promising sections .
molecular imaging can be applied to all parts of medical imaging : early detection , screening , diagnosis , therapy delivery , monitoring , and treatment followup .
the current status of clinical molecular imaging is limited , with most current applications using visual able imaging and a small number of highly specific applications for mri and ultrasound .
current demands and trends are calling for new strategies to focus on early disease detection through improved imaging and screening protocols in retina , as well as patient - specific treatment selection delivery and therapy - specific monitoring .
it is hoped that these new strategies of early diagnosis and immediate treatment monitoring will improve success rates for curing diseases with high mortality rates such as retinal disease and some types of cancer , as well as providing more specific treatment for other diseases .
preclinical research has resulted in the identification of a large number of molecular targets and the development of novel molecular imaging contrast agents as well as device , hardware , and software technologies .
it is expected that molecular imaging in retina with imaging modalities other than our developed mss , pet , mri , molecular ultrasound , and photoacoustic tomography will be integrated into more frequent clinical application in the near future ."	" there is an urgent need for early diagnosis in medicine , whereupon effective treatments could prevent irreversible tissue damage . 
 the special structure of the eye provides a unique opportunity for noninvasive light - based imaging of ocular fundus vasculature . to detect endothelial injury at the early and reversible stage of adhesion molecule upregulation , some novel imaging agents that target retinal endothelial molecules 
 were generated . in vivo molecular imaging 
 has a great potential to impact medicine by detecting diseases or screening disease in early stages , identifying extent of disease , selecting disease and patient - specific therapeutic treatment , applying a directed or targeted therapy , and measuring molecular - specific effects of treatment . 
 current preclinical findings and advances in instrumentation such as endoscopes and microcatheters suggest that these molecular imaging modalities have numerous clinical applications and will be translated into clinical use in the near future . "	"1. Introduction

61	"sensorineural hearing loss is characterized by an elevation of pure tone thresholds and often , difficulty understanding speech , especially in noisy environments . for most patients ,
hearing aids are effective tools for overcoming sensitivity loss , especially when they incorporate recent technological developments .
however , hearing aids are not always capable of helping the patient compensate for difficulties in understanding speech , particularly in a reverberant and/or noisy environment.1 even the most sophisticated hearing aids are unable to improve auditory skills or the comprehension needed for efficient communication .
hearing aids provide increased acoustic information , but alone they are not able to directly modify the brain or the patient s behavior.2 furthermore , peripheral hearing loss may coexist with a central auditory processing deficit , thereby contributing to patient dissatisfaction with amplification , even when audiological tests indicate nearly normal aided hearing thresholds .
auditory training has been highlighted as part of habilitation / rehabilitation for the hearing impaired , though it has been underutilized .
it is primarily based on the belief that the peripheral system benefits from the stimulation provided .
however , advances in neuroscience suggest that it is the central auditory system that benefits from auditory stimulation.24 a number of authors have concluded that the auditory processing evaluation of hearing aid candidates / users provides a more complete profile of auditory skills and may be useful in choosing between different amplification options and complementary remediation tools.3,5,6 therefore , auditory processing tests could contribute to and complement the classical peripheral auditory evaluation .
detailed clinical research in this area is crucial to determining the best approach and technique so as to achieve maximum success with a rehabilitation program .
unfortunately , there do not appear to be any studies in the literature that involve behavioral and electrophysiological measurements of central auditory processing , formal auditory training and self - assessment outcome measures in adult hearing aid users .
the aim of this study was to examine the effects of formal auditory training on adult binaural hearing aid users with mild to moderate bilateral sensorineural hearing loss using the following three procedures : behavioral tests of auditory processing , long - latency auditory evoked potentials and a self - assessment questionnaire .
behavioral tests of auditory processing were employed to identify and monitor any changes in the central auditory system as a result of the auditory training program .
long - latency auditory evoked potentials ( llaep ) were used to plan and monitor rehabilitation outcomes in specific populations . since llaeps are not influenced by the presence of hearing loss , especially in mild and moderate hearing losses , hearing - impaired subjects may be accurately evaluated with this procedure . finally , the inclusion of a self - assessment questionnaire provided the basis for evaluating the success or failure of the auditory training program from an important , objective source  the patient .
all subjects in this double - blind , randomized study met the following inclusion criteria : age between 16 and 60 years old .
no other diagnosed disorders , such as neurological , psychological , cognitive or mental disturbances .
fourteen subjects were randomly divided into two equal groups : an experimental group ( with auditory training ) and control group ( without auditory training ) . aided hearing thresholds ranged from 15 to 35 decibels ( db ) for all subjects with the pure tone average ( 500 , 1000 and 2000 hz ) at 35 decibels hearing level ( db hl ) or better . this study was approved by the ethical committee in research of the universidade federal de so paulo , number 0685/05 .
all subjects , regardless of group placement , received a behavioral auditory processing evaluation and an electrophysiological evaluation and were asked complete a self - assessment questionnaire , the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit ( aphab ) .
these procedures were performed before and after the auditory training for the experimental group and at times coinciding with the beginning and end of the study for the control group . in order to characterize this project as a double - blind study , the examiner who performed the second evaluation did not know whether the subject belonged to the experimental or control group and was unaware of the results of the subject s first test procedures .
the behavioral auditory processing evaluation was carried out with headphones while subjects wore their hearing aids , since all of them were fitted with in - the - ear ( ite ) hearing aids .
as central auditory processing evaluation in hearing aid subjects is a controversial issue , tests were included that have been shown to be more robust in the presence of peripheral auditory damage.5,7 the test battery was designed to ensure maximum use of clinician time during administration as well as to limit the time a subject was exposed to testing procedures , thus offering subjects an optimal opportunity to do well . based on these design elements , the following procedures were selected : sound localization : the patient was instructed to identify the origin of the instrumental sound in five directions ( right , left , above the head , in front of the head and behind the head ) with her / his eyes closed .
memory for verbal sounds in sequence : the patient was instructed to repeat the syllables pa , ta , ca , fa in three different sequences without any visual clues .
memory for nonverbal sounds in sequence : the patient was asked to reproduce three sequences of four instrumental sounds without any visual clues .
word recognition score with recorded stimuli : two lists of 25 recorded monosyllables were presented to each ear separately , and the patient was asked to repeat each of them .
speech - in - noise test : two different lists of 25 monosyllables were presented to each ear in the presence of ipsilateral white noise using a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of + 5 , and the patient was asked to repeat each monosyllable while ignoring the noise . synthetic sentence identification ( ssi ) : the patient was instructed to point to the sentence presented in the headphones on a chart displayed in front of him / her while ignoring the competitive stimuli represented by a verbal discourse .
binaural integration condition : the patient was asked to repeat twenty series of four digits presented dichotically . all tests , except sound localization and memory for verbal and nonverbal sounds in sequence , which were performed in a sound field using musical instruments , were performed using recorded stimuli from a commercially available brazilian compact disc ( cd)8 .
as the subjects of our study exhibited nearly normal aided hearing thresholds , their performance was compared to the expected levels for subjects with normal hearing .
the electrophysiological evaluation in this study consisted of measures of long - latency auditory evoked potentials 
n1 , p2 , n2 and p3 , registered without hearing aids using an odd - ball paradigm with tone bursts .
the frequent and rare stimuli were 1000 hz and 2000 hz tones with 80% and 20% of probability , respectively .
the intensity level varied from 70 to 85 db hl , according to the residual hearing in the test frequencies involved.9 a four - channel biologic systems unit was used to measure the llaep recordings .
inter - electrode impedance of 5 kohms or less was guaranteed during the entire recording .
subjects were asked to lie still with their eyes closed while silently counting the number of  different  ( rare ) stimuli .
the latencies and amplitudes of the n1 , p2 and n2 components were marked in the rare tracings .
the subtraction of rare from frequent tracings created a waveform from which p3 latency and amplitude were determined .
the aphab was used to study the subjective effectiveness of the auditory training.10 this instrument has been translated and validated in portuguese.11 aphab is a self - assessment questionnaire used to quantify auditory difficulties experienced in daily situations involving communication in quiet , noisy and reverberant environments .
it is usually administered before and after fitting amplification as a mechanism to verify the benefit provided by hearing aids .
all subjects completed an aphab in two different situations , before and after auditory training in the experimental group , and as initial and final evaluations in the control group .
as subjects were already wearing hearing aids in both situations , patients were asked to answer the questionnaire using only the column corresponding to  with hearing aids  .
our formal auditory training program was organized into eight one - hour sessions , held twice a week for four weeks .
all sessions were performed with hearing aids and designed to provide intensive stimulation and challenge the auditory system . for these purposes ,
the snr was varied from positive ( easier ) to negative ( more difficult ) during each activity that involved ignoring competitive stimuli . during monaural activities , such as temporal processing training ,
activities involved pointing to sentences , figures , digits , verbal repetition and humming temporal patterns . right and left ears were trained separately in an attempt to compensate for interaural differences usually observed in behavioral auditory processing tests , except during binaural integration activities and temporal processing training , when sound field presentation was used .
the stimulation paradigm of each ear was as follows : the intensity level was fixed for the ear under training while the contralateral intensity level was increased ( snr from positive to negative ) , and the patient s task was to pay attention to the stimuli delivered to the ear under training while ignoring the contralateral messages .
this paradigm is similar to one known as dichotic interaural intensity difference ( diid)12 that was proposed by an american audiologist . in order to keep the patients motivated ,
a 70% correct response rate was required at each step of the training before the patient was permitted to advance to another activity .

table 1 summarizes the formal auditory training ( fat ) schedule employed in the present study .
all data obtained from the behavioral central auditory processing test battery , electrophysiological evaluation and aphab were statistically analyzed . to investigate the effects of the fat program ,
the student t - test was used to compare the performance variance of subjects from both control and experimental groups , in both evaluations ( pre- and post - training ) , considering behavioral auditory processing tests , the electrophysiological test and the aphab .
the significance level was set at 5% ( p = 0.05 ) , and confidence intervals were established at 95% .
significant values are highlighted by the symbol ( * ) , and tendency toward statistical significance values are highlighted by the symbol ( # ) .
table 2 shows the amount of improvement in behavioral auditory processing tests of the control group comparing pre- and post - training evaluations .
no significant differences in performance were observed for the majority of behavioral tests , expect for ssi - icm snrs -10 and -15 , which revealed better results post - training .
table 3 shows the amount of improvement in behavioral auditory processing tests of the experimental group by comparing pre- and post - training evaluations .
significant differences in performance of the experimental group were observed when comparing the tests results pre- and post - training , demonstrating improved performance following training .
table 4 ( variation in latency and amplitude values of llaep for the control group when pre- and post - training evaluations were compared ) shows that significant differences were observed for the latencies of p2 and n2 llaep components . for p2 an increase in latency
was observed , while for n2 a decrease in latency was verified when comparing pre- and post - training evaluations .
variation in latency and amplitude values of llaep of the experimental group when comparing pre- and post - training evaluations ) it is easily seen that for the experimental group , a significantly lower latency was observed for the p3 component of llaep when comparing pre- and post - training evaluations . as with the control group ,
no significant differences were seen concerning latency . finally , in table 6 ( benefit observed in aphab of control and experimental groups when comparing pre- and post - training administration ) , we present the comparison of benefit observed through the administration of the aphab to the control and experimental groups .
no differences were noted for the control group , while there was a trend toward statistical significance for the experimental group in the reverberation and background noise sub - scales .
all patients exhibited abnormal results on at least one of the tests during the pre - training evaluation .
thus , everyone demonstrated auditory difficulties with degraded stimuli , as previously reported in different studies.1,13,14 auditory difficulty could not be predicted by either functional gain or word recognition scores in quiet , as results were within normal limits under such conditions .
prior to the auditory training program , performance in the control group was generally poorer than in the experimental group the limited amount of improvement in behavioral tests by the control group ( table 2 ) suggest that all behavioral tests used , except ssi - icm ( -10 and -15 ) , were of minimal value .
interestingly poorer results were seen during the post - training evaluation after some tests , including word recognition scores and the speech in noise test . when considering ssi - icm ( -10 and -15 ) , significant differences were observed between pre- and post - training evaluations .
this improvement , although insufficient to explain the results completely , could be attributed to patients familiarity with the procedure leading them to ignore the competitive message while focusing on the target sentence .
this has occurred in one previous study , where the control groups , without training , showed some improvements during the re - evaluations.15 however , these improvements were not of the same magnitude as those observed in the groups which underwent auditory training .
the performance of the experimental group during the post - training evaluation was better than the first evaluation ( table 3 ) , since the comparison between post- and pre - training performance resulted in positive values for all tests .
statistically significant differences were observed in sound localization , memory for nonverbal sounds in sequence , the speech in noise test , dichotic digits and ssi - icm ( 0 , -10 , -15 ) , with ssi - icm ( -15 ) demonstrating an improvement of almost 70% .
this is interpreted to mean that formal auditory training was effective in improving central auditory skills.1618 the post - training evaluation of the experimental group was within established limits for adults with normal hearing . when sound is introduced into an impaired auditory system , spectral and temporal cues in the central auditory nervous system are altered . as a result , patients are forced to combine different spectral and temporal codes as they remember speech sounds . failure to do so culminates in difficulties in understanding , especially in situations with ambient noise .
this was confirmed by the results of the present study during the speech in noise test , in which the subjects performance was negatively influenced by the introduction of noise .
the stimuli were the same in both quiet and noise ; only the order of presentation was changed .
the results indicate that amplification provided by the hearing aids was insufficient to maintain the same quality in both quiet and noisy environments ( table 2 ) .
however , this auditory skill may be improved with auditory training ( table 3 ) . finally , it is possible that hearing aid fitting alone fails to produce the ideal environment for the auditory system and its skills.2,6,19,20 when a central auditory processing disorder co - exists with peripheral hearing loss , compensation obtained from hearing aids is at times insufficient to compensate for the auditory processing disorder ( apd ) , and the patient may become dissatisfied and frustrated with the performance of the hearing aids.2,19 based on our results , auditory processing evaluations
although there were no significant differences between right and left ears for either group on any of the experimental measures , individual results for some patients in both the control and experimental groups demonstrated asymmetrical results in central auditory processing tests , such as dichotic digits , speech in noise and ssi - icm .
such differences were minimized for subjects in the experimental group after the completion of training .
the phenomenon of binaural interference is suspected when performance in speech tests with binaural amplification is worse than with monaural or without hearing aids.4,6,2123 in cases of binaural interference , a unilateral hearing aid fitting is advisable .
it is important to consider that in the case of a monaural fitting , the unaided ear may suffer the deleterious effects of sensory deprivation , affecting neural plasticity and leading to a progressive degradation of word recognition on the non - aided side .
this can occur even when auditory thresholds are stable.14,24 as discussed above , one could question whether it would be more reasonable to document asymmetry in a patient with a central auditory processing disorder and then fit both ears to maximize the advantages of binaural hearing . after waiting a reasonable acclimatization period ,
the patient would be enrolled in a formal auditory training program , at the end of which the decision would be made as to whether a binaural or a monaural hearing aid fitting is more suitable .
one of the most controversial aspects of formal auditory training is the use of the same test for training and evaluation .
training for the test  , thereby resulting in a positive bias during re - evaluation .
nonetheless , our results suggest that generalization in non - trained contexts is possible since , in the tests used only for evaluation , including sound localization , memory for verbal and nonverbal sounds and the speech in noise tests , objective and subjective measures showed improved results for the experimental group after training .
such results can be attributed to the auditory training with a considerable degree of confidence .
generalization for non - trained situations has been mentioned in several previous studies.16 , 2528 the maintenance of any learned pattern depends on its use.27,29 therefore , it seems reasonable to conclude that benefits accrued from the auditory training program will be maintained if the patient continues to use what he or she has learned .
however , future studies are needed to determined if this is the case . concerning llaep ,
the n1-p2-n2 and p3 complexes were identified in all patients from both the control and experimental groups , and all subjects exhibited latency values within normal limits .
these results concur with those of previous authors , who have noted that the presence of peripheral hearing loss , especially to mild and moderate degrees ( which is the case in this study ) , does not prevent the registration of late potentials , since the patient is able to perceive both rare and frequent stimuli.3032 however , also mentioned in other studies is considerable inter - subject variability for both latency and amplitude values.15,27,37 statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between right and left ears .
since both ears were considered in the study , statistical analysis was made more reliable , as the sample size was doubled .
the control and experimental groups did not differ with regard to llaep components in latency or amplitude in the first evaluation .
however , when comparing the variation in latencies values between pre and post training evaluations of the control group ( table 4 ) , significant changes were observed for p2 and n2 latencies . the p2 component showed an increase in latency of 12.86 ms , while a decrease of 5.60 ms was observed for the n2 component .
the n1-p2-n2 complex of llaep is influenced by attention.9 if the target stimulus is ignored , waveforms may be attenuated , and possible delays in latency may be observed .
for the experimental group , a statistically significant reduction in p3 latency ( 27 ms ) was observed when comparing latency between the pre- and post - training electrophysiological evaluation ( table 5 ) . although no statistical differences were demonstrated in p3 latency for the control group , a slight increase in latency of 6.43 ms was noted ( table 4 )
. latency reduction of evoked potentials after auditory training has been described as a neurophysiologic correlate of neural plasticity . in many cases ,
this change may precede a behavioral change , which could take longer since it requires the integration of neural modifications and conscious perception and also involves higher cognitive processes.15,33,34 furthermore , latency reduction may be understood as an improvement in electrophysiological function .
this improvement may be attributed to the auditory training , as the training was carried out after the acclimatization period.11,14,35,36 finally , as an objective measure of neural change , the improvement appears to influence neural plasticity in adults , as mentioned in a number of other studies.6,28,29,34,3739 since the importance of temporal aspects in maximizing auditory skills is well recognized , the latency reduction observed in the experimental group may be of critical importance for improving communication for hearing aid users , especially in adverse environments .
this improvement , along with advanced hearing aid technology , may help patients in daily situations , leading to improved use of hearing aids and better social integration .
no statistically significant differences were observed in the variation of amplitude between the pre- and post - training evaluations for both groups ( tables 4 and 5 ) .
the increase in amplitude , especially of p3 after auditory training , suggests better synchrony in neural firing and attention improvement and has also been shown to be related to neural plasticity.15,27,28,34,38,40 there is still controversy regarding which parameter , latency or amplitude , is the better indicator of neurophysiologic improvement when determining the efficacy of a specific therapeutic approach.33 we conclude that amplitude , as measured in the present study , does not allow for inferences about the efficiency of the auditory training program described here .
our results were the same as those previously noted in different studies in the literature.27,28,31,38 the results from this portion of the study suggest that the behavioral and electrophysiological improvements observed in the experimental group after training support central changes and improved functioning and highlight the importance of establishing the interaction between the central auditory nervous system and amplified sound , as previously recommended.36,39 the aphab self - assessment questionnaire was selected to help determine whether the expected / observed changes in electrophysiological and behavioral evaluations would interfere with the patient s subjective evaluation .
there does not appear to be a specific self - assessment questionnaire designed to quantify changes observed in adult hearing aid users following a specific auditory training program .
however , aphab has been shown to be a powerful instrument for recording the benefit of a specific therapeutic approach.41 thus , we felt it the most appropriate self - assessment questionnaire for our study .
self - assessment questionnaires have played a very important role in the validation stage of hearing aid fitting , as they reveal the benefits perceived in daily situations with amplification.35 the similarity of responses for both groups regarding the ease of communication sub - scale ( ec ) indicates that the patients were well - adapted to their hearing aids , mainly in silent environments and/or in conversations involving small groups in relatively quiet places .
however , the vast majority complained of difficulties hearing in noisy environments ( table 6 ) . some admitted they removed their hearing aids in such environments .
this strategy frequently put them in embarrassing situations , leaving them feeling uncomfortable with their hearing aids in and missing important parts of conversations , dialogues and lectures without them .
as the subjects in our study wore hearing aids in both situations when answering the aphab , the magnitude of benefit should not be the same as was seen during the original application of this instrument .
no significant differences were observed in the control group at all sub - scales , when comparing the first and second applications .
this suggests that reported difficulties remained stable , as previously reported.42 however for the experimental group , communicating in noisy and reverberant environments was easier than before the training .
table 6 shows the comparison of percentage of difficulties experienced by the participants in the sub - scales of aphab for both applications of the questionnaires , pre- and post - training .
although the differences observed in the experimental group in reverberation and background noise sub - scales only trended toward statistical significance , all sub - scales revealed negative values , indicating that after auditory training participants in the experimental group reported fewer difficulties in daily situations .
this means that communication in adverse environments became easier for the experimental group following auditory training . in another study ,
90% of adult hearing aid users felt more capable and more confident in challenging auditory situations after auditory training with a commercial available cd - rom.2 the opposite occurred in the control group , where positive values were seen in the ease of communication , background noise and averseness to loud sound sub - scales ( table 6 ) .
improvements for the experimental group were previously noticed in electrophysiological and behavioral evaluations ( tables 2 to 5 ) .
although subjects in both groups were similar in peripheral hearing status and hearing aid technology , environmental differences are expected and may account for differences in subjective measures such as self - assessment questionnaires .
communication improvement in noisy environments should be the primary goal of any auditory training program , especially since such environments are common in everyday life .
however , there is still the chance of having a subject whose hearing thresholds have been made normal but who has an auditory processing disorder .
such a patient would not complain of difficulties in receiving sounds but rather in interpreting them , especially in the presence of increasing noise .
it is suggested that administering an auditory training program , as described in the present study , and a self - assessment questionnaire , such as the aphab , could make the assessment and identification of hearing - impaired patients with an additional auditory processing disorder easier .
the results of the present study suggest that formal auditory training was able to improve the central auditory skills of hearing aid users .
improvement was noted in an objective neurophysiologic correlate and perceived by patients , as revealed in a self - assessment questionnaire .
therefore , we strongly advocate investing time searching for the presence of a central auditory processing disorder during the course of all hearing aid fittings .
furthermore , programs for rehabilitation of these skills are essential for all patients identified , regardless of age . in many cases , the high cost of hearing aids prevents patients from acquiring them , particularly if the patient feels that the benefit will not outweigh the high cost of the investment . including an initial auditory processing evaluation and formal auditory training should provide a basis for such patients to feel more confident about purchasing a sophisticated and expensive hearing aid .
audiologists play an important role in this situation by helping patients realize the importance of auditory training and introducing it as a part of the hearing aid fitting process . after a critical analysis of the results
, we can conclude that formal auditory training in adult hearing aid users promotes : latency reduction of the p3 component of llaep .
improvement in auditory skills for sound localization , memory for nonverbal sounds in sequence , auditory closure and figure - to - ground for verbal sounds ."	" introductionindividuals with sensorineural hearing loss are often able to regain some lost auditory function with the help of hearing aids 
 . however , hearing aids are not able to overcome auditory distortions such as impaired frequency resolution and speech understanding in noisy environments . 
 the coexistence of peripheral hearing loss and a central auditory deficit may contribute to patient dissatisfaction with amplification , even when audiological tests indicate nearly normal hearing thresholds.objectivethis study was designed to validate the effects of a formal auditory training program in adult hearing aid users with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss.methodsfourteen bilateral hearing aid users were divided into two groups : seven who received auditory training and seven who did not . 
 the training program was designed to improve auditory closure , figure - to - ground for verbal and nonverbal sounds and temporal processing ( frequency and duration of sounds ) . 
 pre- and post - training evaluations included measuring electrophysiological and behavioral auditory processing and administration of the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit ( aphab ) self - report scale.resultsthe post - training evaluation of the experimental group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in p3 latency , improved performance in some of the behavioral auditory processing tests and higher hearing aid benefit in noisy situations ( p - value < 0,05 ) . 
 no changes were noted for the control group ( p - value < 0,05).conclusionthe results demonstrated that auditory training in adult hearing aid users can lead to a reduction in p3 latency , improvements in sound localization , memory for nonverbal sounds in sequence , auditory closure , figure - to - ground for verbal sounds and greater benefits in reverberant and noisy environments .

thirty - three genets were represented by a single mushroom , which equates to about 94% of the genets .
the percentage of genets represented by a single mushroom varied significantly from 44% to 94% over 2 yr .
the average number of fruiting bodies per genet was 1.4 , and the largest genet length was 2.9 m. at location c , s. granulatus mushrooms fruited in fragments , in a complicated manner , or and in a line ( fig .
eight mushrooms that fruited in 2013 were delineated into four genets ( table 3 ) .
, the 16 mushrooms that fruited were delineated into 11 genets , 7 of which were represented by a single mushroom ( table 3 ) . in other words , 10 of the 15 ( 67% )
the average number of mushrooms per genet was 1.60 , and the longest genet was 2.79 m.
ectomycorrhizal fungal colonies are grouped into three basic types : the fairy ring , irregular mat , and dispersed colony types .
the fairy ring type grows as a distinctly dense , circular mycelial colony below the ground , and mushrooms forming this type of colonies belong to the genera cantharellus , tricholoma , and agaricus .
mushrooms forming irregular mat type colonies include those from the genera cortinarius , sarcodon , and suillus .
mushrooms forming dispersed colonies include those from the genera amanita , boletus , russula , and marasmius , as well as litterdecomposing mushrooms .
although the width of below - ground mycelial colonies of t. matsutake are about 1 m , the front edge of the live hyphal portion of the colonies are only approximately 20 cm , and only the front continues to grow in length .
organic matter decomposing fungi living in plant residues on the soil surface also grow out in all directions from the center .
these mycelial colonies are from somatic cells with two nuclei , and thus , the mushrooms genets from the colonies should be the same
. however , our molecular marker analysis showed that genets from the fruiting bodies in the colonies were different . in nature
there are two types of processes that allow the formation of ectomycorrhizal fungal colonies : one is mating between two compatible monokaryotic ( haploid ) mycelia from spores , and the other is dikaryotic ( haploid ) mycelial growth .
our study showed that the genets of fruiting bodies in the p. strobus stand that occurred very closely to each other in 2013 and 2014 were genetically different .
this suggests that the genets of s. granulatus have been frequently changing due to the combination of the monokaryotic haploid hyphae from introduced sexual basidiospores ( fig . 8) and the existing dikaryotic haploid ectomycorrhizal mycelia below the ground ( fig .
the percentage of genets represented by a single mushroom ranged from 44% to 94% of the total genets depending on the year of occurrence and locations , and the average numbers of mushrooms per genet were 1.2 to 2.3 .
similarly , in the case of s. spraguei in a natural p. strobus stand , 42 out of 46 genets from 50 sporocarps sampled were represented by a single sporocarp , while the remaining 4 genets were represented by 2 sporocarps , resulting in an average number of sporocarps per genet of only 1.09 . in the late successional ectomycorrhizal species , r. brevipes , 33% to 50% of its genets
the fruiting bodies that occurred in a limited space showed high genetic diversity , but the size of each genet did not exceed 1.0 m . in the case of a pioneer and early successional species , l. laccata ,
the genets tend to disappear within a few months after sporocarp formation , and the new genets that appeared from the spores were significantly smaller in size and larger in quantity and dispersed during the fruiting season .
the high densities and annual renewal of laccaria genets indicated frequent turnover by sexual reproduction via spores . during its fruiting season , most genets of the l. laccata mushrooms were identical to the mycelial genets below the ground .
however , nine months after the fruiting season , new genets were observed , and the genets from the previous year 's fruiting bodies were not detected in 60% of the plots .
this means that , like in the case of the genets of s. granulatus in this study , the genets of l. laccata may have changed due to the combination of the dikaryotic ectomycorrhizal mycelia in the soil and the monokaryotic hyphae from new spores to change their genets and produced the fruiting bodies . for mushrooms to reproduce and propagate ,
the spores disperse from mushroom gills and germinate when the humidity , temperature and nutrition are appropriate .
hyphae grown from germinated spores combine with hyphae from other spores to form a mycelial mat and develop primordial to mature mushrooms . meanwhile , in a stable ecosystem such as a fully grown forest , the new roots are surrounded by existing mycorrhizal roots , and therefore , the new spores have a rare chance to infect new roots . thus , soil disturbances that destroy the existing fungal colonies can provide a place for the settlement of new spores . in nature ,
early successional ectomycorrhizal fungi form mycorrhizal symbiosis with their host plant roots by spores , which are dispersed into the soil , and the mycorrhizas can be replaced by late successional fungal species as the hosts grow .
on the other hand , if the vegetation is stable and early successional mycorrhizal species are persistent , then the transition of the spores becomes delayed .
mushrooms that have a strong predisposition to form fairy - ring type colonies such as t. matsutake   maintain their colony through existing mycelium in the soil rather than newly dispersed spores .
however , our results suggest that the genets of ectomycorrhizal colonies may have been constantly diversifying as a result of fusion with hyphae from the basidiospores produced during fruiting season .
this genetic diversification may contribute to the survival of the colonies under changing environmental conditions , such as the conditions of the host and soil and the weather .
many studies have shown that the genet sizes of ectomycorrhizal fungi were very diverse , depending on the host species , host ages and habitats .
the genet sizes were 300 m in s. pungens , 1 m or less in l. amethystina   and russula cremoricolor , 12.5 m in laccaria bicolor , 2.27 to 7.65 m in s. spraguei , and 3.5 m in diameter in hebeloma cylindrosporum .
the size of collybia fusipes genets in decomposing fallen leaves varied in size from very small to a few millimeter . on the other hand , genets of armillaria bulbosa , a root - disease pathogen in forest trees , can cover as much as 1 km .
the genet densities of ectomycorrhizal mushroom populations were also considerably varied between 30 and 5,000 per ha . in this study , 44 to 94% of s. granulatus genets were represented by a single fruiting body , and the longest genet was approximately 2.9 m and composed of five fruiting bodies . in conclusion ,
the genets of s. granulates mushrooms were varied even though they occurred very closely and became more varied every year .
this means that the below - ground mycelial mat of s. granulatus , composed of vegetative hyphal cells , can be renewed sexually by fusing with haploid hyphae from spores produced in the mushroom gills . the small stand area and the short 2-yr survey period limits the interpretation of the formation of new genets of s. granulatus .
further studies will be needed to clarify the role of fusion between the hyphae from basiospores and the belowground ectomycorrhizal mycelia in genet variation of s. granulatus .

" the genets of suillus granulatus in a pinus strobus stand ( 13 m  60 m ) were identified using random amplified polymorphic dna molecular markers and the dna of mushrooms that fruited for two years , and variations in genet size and distribution were analyzed . from a total of 116 mushrooms , 
 73 genets were identified and were grouped into three locations . 
 the genets of mushrooms in close proximity differed from each other . 
 the genet sizes varied at any of the three locations . 
 the lengths of the identified genets in the pine stand ranged from 0.09 to 2.90 m. the average number of mushrooms per genet was 1.2 to 2.3 , and the percentage of genets that were represented by a single mushroom was 44% to 94% . 
 this variation in the genets of mushrooms in close proximity suggests that the ectomycorrhizal mycelial bodies of s. granulatus propagated sexually by fusing haploid spores derived from the mushrooms gills with below - ground mycelia . 
 therefore , it is necessary further to investigate the formation of new genets through spores in ectomycorrhizal fungal colonies . "	"MATERIALS AND METHODS

64	"a report , published in september 2009 , from the world health organization ( who)-sponsored study includes tuberculosis ( tb ) and aids with a share of 5.5% each in the list of top 10 causes of death in all 1024 year olds , males and females combined , globally . this has revealed an urgency to act on these issues with all our available resources and an approach to improve upon them .
stop tb partnership announced the theme for world tuberculosis day 2010 as  on the move against tuberculosis : innovate to accelerate action .
 this calls for ideas and projects to come up with something other than what we have been practicing for long .
improving the research in tb has been a neglected area for long , in part due to the complex characteristics of the causal organism mycobacterium tuberculosis , the variable host response to infection , and , perhaps , complacency as this disease was nearly eradicated in high - income settings . with increasing hiv 
tb co - infections , tb has become a high priority for action and research in international health again .
looking into this , who and the world bank , with international union against tuberculosis and lung disease ( iuatld ) , centre for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) , and other organizations , are reassessing their approaches to the prevention and control of tb .
of late , agencies such as the foundation for innovative new diagnostics ( find ) , stop tb partnership 's new diagnostics working group ( ndwg ) , global laboratory initiative ( gli , another stop tb partnership working group ) , who , and the special program for research and training in tropical diseases ( tdr ) have shown increased interest toward the development of better diagnostics for tb .
funding agencies such as the bill and melinda gates foundation , the global fund to fight aids , tb and malaria ( gfatm ) , and unitaid have emerged as resource providers for work on this disease that was being neglected in terms of sponsorship and interest of the private sector till now . with this , lots of efforts and funds are being brought up for the development of newer diagnostic methods in mycobacteriology .
there are multiple hurdles to cross before we reach the ultimate goal of having an efficacious vaccine , easy and affordable diagnosis , and short - term treatment regimens with minimal side effects .
in the field of tb , problem starts at the very first step , i.e. , diagnosing the case .
conventional tb diagnosis has been relying on medical history , tuberculin skin test , chest x - rays , and bacteriological examination .
m. tuberculosis grows slowly , and clinical specimens submitted to the tb microscopy and culture are contaminated to varying degrees by more rapidly growing unwanted normal flora .
. moreover , the hydrophobic nature of the cell wall due to a high concentration of mycolic acid makes it more difficult to stain mycobaterial cells .
the poor sensitivity of conventional smear microscopy has been a major concern . with various samples and sample processing methods ,
it has been found to be around 3643% sensitive . in general , direct smear reportedly detects afb only at concentrations of around 10,000 bacilli / ml of the specimen .
conversely , as few as 100 bacilli / ml may be required for a positive culture .
various modifications to the technique and higher level of sophistications have been introduced in this field to get the highest level of sensitivity . with certain variations in the sample processing methods for smear preparation ,
samples were subjected to different centrifugation forces and centrifugation times after decontamination and liquefaction and the centrifuged deposits were examined by smear and culture .
the sensitivity of detection at an rcf of 4000 g for 15 min was 5000 organisms / ml for a smear .
various workers have demonstrated the improved detection of direct smear - negative cases by universal sample processing ( usp ) smear microscopy .
the highest limit of detection in smear microscopy after employing the usp methodology and observing 400500 fields was experimentally found to be 250300 bacilli / ml of the sample . under the best conditions for culture on solid and liquid media with
usp - treated spiked sputum , the detection limit was found to be 400 cfu / ml after 8 weeks of incubation .
hence , although it could reduce the bacilli count needed to be detected using smear , it has not helped improving detection by culture .
however , the researchers felt a need for a more sensitive test to detect samples with a low bacterial load .
steingart and co - workers did a systematic review to assess the ability of different processing methods to improve the sensitivity of microscopy .
their search suggested that centrifugation with any of several chemical methods ( including bleach ) is more sensitive , that overnight sedimentation preceded by chemical processing is more sensitive , and that the specificity is similar .
recently , a pilot study has compared the diagnostic accuracy and incremental yield of two short - duration ( < 1 h ) sputum pretreatment procedures involving pretreatment with bleach and usp centrifugation and concluded that both did not increase yield as compared to direct sputum smears .
people tried hard for developing field - based methods to avoid the use of centrifugation during decontamination .
but it was found to have a lower sensitivity as compared to the conventional method of centrifuge decontamination .
fluorescence microscopy is credited with increased sensitivity and lower work effort but has a rider of increased cost and technical complexity .
pai and co - workers have reported an average 10% increment in sensitivity of microscopy using fluorescence microscopy with no difference in specificity .
lange and mori have given an update on the developments being made in the field of fluorescent microscopy .
these include light - emitting diode ( led)-based fluorescent microscopy , mobile phone - based microscopy , and automated detection systems using image processing . with many more other studies ,
it is very apparent that we are still struggling hard to get a sensitive , easy , cost - effective , and faster method for smear microscopy .
it seems possible to decrease mortality and morbidity due to tb using smear microscopy diagnosis and dots coverage , as being done in most of the high prevalence countries like india .
but as many smear negative cases may remain undiagnosed , cutting transmission of infection does not seem to be an achievable target without having better diagnostic amenities .
just the presence of acid - fast bacilli ( afb ) on a sputum smear or other specimens does not confirm a diagnosis of tb as all acid - fast - bacilli are not m. tuberculosis .
also , bacterial isolation for drug - susceptibility testing and genotyping is required using a solid or liquid medium .
therefore , a culture is expected on all initial samples to confirm the diagnosis followed by biochemical tests like catalase test at 68c , nitrate reduction , and niacin accumulation for speciation .
although culture - based diagnosis of tb is recommended in international standards of tuberculosis care , lack of resources and technical expertise poses as a major limitation in most of the high prevalence countries .
traditionally , primary isolation and culture of mycobacteria is performed on agar or lowenstein  jensen ( lj ) media .
drug susceptibility testing of isolates is done using the same medium following the proportion method .
this method compares the mycobacterial growth levels in clinical isolates to be tested with known standard culture in the presence of different concentrations of anti - tb drugs in a proportional way .
this method enables a determination of the concentration that inhibits more than 99% of the inoculum and is reported as the minimal inhibitory concentration ( mic ) of the given drug .
this is considered as a  gold standard .  but it is cumbersome , technically demanding , lacks reproducibility , and it generally takes at least 21 days for a result after assay set - up .
liquid culturing with radioisotopic detection or with the incorporation of fluorescent dyes was introduced in the past as a confirmatory method ( bactec 460 , bactec mgit 960 system , mb / bact , and versa trek system ) . however , looking at the sophistication and issues like contamination , the struggle again started to search something better .
microscopic observation drug susceptibility ( mods ) testing developed recently allows both rapid and low - cost tb diagnosis in liquid culture with the simultaneous determination of drug susceptibilities.[1618 ] however , mods requires higher biosafety level facilities , an expert and experienced microbiologist , and the samples are very prone to contaminations .
thus , it needs addition of various antibiotics in culture media and the samples need to be processed before inoculation involving decontamination and centrifugation steps .
some other unconventional methods like thin - layer agar ( tla ) and the direct nitrate reductase assay ( nra ) have attempted to address the problem of multiple point processing and hence the generation of aerosols by incorporating visual inspection of results in the form of typical colony morphology or color change to identify tb growth .
although they have tried to make things simple , they could not avoid the most cumbersome step of specimen processing .
microbiological detection is possible only once the microbial load in the sample reaches a substantial number . some other situations like immune suppression and in the case of children , getting a good quality sample and getting the required microbial load in the samples is tough .
hence , indirect approaches to trace the causal organism / byproducts or to look into the host response against the infection are also being considered .
the pcr - based amplification of various target nucleic acids has been tried extensively that allows rapid and sensitive detection of target dna sequences .
ideally , pcr can detect a single copy of the gene being targeted for amplification but with all the processing to avoid interference , the detection of as few as 410 copies has been made possible by several workers .
various targets have been tried and tested to get better identification or speciation till date .
although the 16s rrna gene is the most commonly used target , other targets have also provided a high - sensitivity and representative species - specific differentiation .
the pcr amplification of the entire 16s23s rrna spacer region and use of a secondary technique of randomly amplified polymorphic dna ( rapd ) fingerprinting to differentiate strains belonging to the mycobacterium species has been reported .
the amplification of the entire 16s23s intergenic region , and diagnostic tests for bacterial organisms using probes targeted for sequences within the 16s23s intergenic region have also been described .
other targets include the 16s rrna gene , the 16s23s internal transcribed spacer , the 65-kda heat shock protein , reca , rpob , and gyrb.[232629 ] the 16s rrna gene - based methods are presently widely used for the identification and differentiation of mycobacteria.[3034 ] however , some species can not be differentiated by their 16s sequences because the number of polymorphic sites in the 16s rrna gene in the genus mycobacterium is rather small ( e.g. , mycobacterium kansasii and mycobacterium gastri ) , while others possess a very high degree of sequence similarity ( e.g. , mycobacterium marinum and mycobacterium ulcerans , mycobacterium abscessus , and mycobacterium chelonae ) . the 16s23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer ( its ) region contains both conserved and highly variable signatures and is rather small .
the 16s23s rrna gene its - based pcr produces a relatively small pcr product ( 200350 bp ) .
this sequence of the 16s23s rrna its can distinguish between m. kansasii and m gastri ; however , it fails to distinguish between m. marinum and m. ulcerans and needs secondary methods like rflp or line blot hybridization to get conclusive results as demonstrated by various workers .
the first marketed test was inno - lipa mycobacteria ( innogenetics ) in which the 16s23s intergenic region was amplified and then hybridized to a membrane on which were attached probes that recognized mycobacterial species revealed by colorimetry .
the same principle was used to develop genotype mtbc tests ( hain lifescience gmbh , nehrin , germany ) , which use multiplex amplification of dna fragments ( 23s rrna gene , rd1 region , and gyrb gene ) to differentiate m. tuberculosis complex species ( mycobacterium tuberculosis , mycobacterium bovis ssp bovis , m. bovis bcg , bovis ssp caprae , mycobacterium africanum , mycobacterium canettii , and mycobacterium microti ) . the hsp65 gene - based pcr restriction pattern analysis ( pra )
mcnabb and co - workers assessed the use of partial sequences of the hsp65 gene for the routine identification of mycobacteria and reported an overall agreement of 85.2% with other identification methods ; discrepancies were most frequently encountered with isolates of m. chelonae , mycobacterium fortuitum , mycobacterium gordonae , mycobacterium scrofulaceum , and mycobacterium terrae .
the amplification of the seca1 gene that codes for the essential protein seca1 , a key component of the major pathway of protein secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane , has also been tried .
it was demonstrated that the seca1 gene of the genus mycobacterium can be used for species - level or complex - level ( for the mtb complex ) identification .
it was also found that seca1 is a suitable target for diagnostics as the degree of interspecies variation for gene sequences among mycobacteria was observed to be moderate .
these conclusions came from nonexhaustive studies and a need for further inputs for the improvement of the same was felt . apart from costly and cumbersome probe - based methods , combining the detection of various characteristic features or the multiple species identification using multiplex pcr also seems to be promising .
for instance , to detect three mycobacterial species , the multiplex pcr is estimated to cost at least half that of a commercial dna probe which is used to identify only one of the three pathogens that can be identified by a multiplex pcr assay . in this regard , the use of the multiplex pcr could provide large savings in time , costs , and laboratory resources compared with the use of the expensive commercial dna probes , subcloning procedures , and biochemical tests .
the use of multiplex pcr to detect members of the mycobacterium genus and to detect and differentiate m. tuberculosis , mycobacterium avium , and mycobacterium intracellulare has also been investigated .
however , there exist a few limitations with respect to dna isolation , species identification , and obtaining cultures from a sophisticated system like bactec as a source to begin with .
the recent development of the real - time pcr - based instrument named genexpert system , recently endorsed by the who , has led to the rapid detection of tb and drug resistance at the point of care . the mtb / rif test using this system provided sensitive detection of tb and rifampin resistance directly from the untreated sputum in less than 2 h with minimal hands - on time . who has recently issued a policy statement for the xpert mtb / rif system .
this statement provides a brief description of the results obtained from various analytical studies , controlled clinical validation trials , field demonstration studies , etc .
analysis with this system reports the detection of five genomic copies and 131 cfu / ml mtb spiked in sputum . based on the results , it has been recommended that 
 xpert mtb / rif should be used as the initial diagnostic test in individuals suspected of mdr - tb or hiv - associated tb ( strong recommendation).xpert mtb / rif may be used as a follow - on test to microscopy in settings where mdr and/or hiv is of lesser concern , especially in smear - negative specimens ( conditional recommendation , recognizing major resource implications ) . 
 
xpert mtb / rif should be used as the initial diagnostic test in individuals suspected of mdr - tb or hiv - associated tb ( strong recommendation ) .
xpert mtb / rif may be used as a follow - on test to microscopy in settings where mdr and/or hiv is of lesser concern , especially in smear - negative specimens ( conditional recommendation , recognizing major resource implications ) . however , conventional microscopy , culture , and dst , which are required to monitor treatment progress and to detect resistance to drugs other than rifampicin were found to be indispensible at this time .
also several operational conditions need to be maintained for proper functioning of the instrument . apart from this
, the cost of the instrument and the cartridges used is another concern that is being negotiated and taken care of by agencies like find .
currently , there is an urgent need for a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic method for the identification of active m. tuberculosis disease that can be performed at the point of care , i.e. , outside the traditional laboratory setting .
as serological methods have never shown to be very consistent in terms of their sensitivity and specificity for the detection of m. tuberculosis infection , research has again focused on finding new biomarkers for better detection .
developing a method that uses alternate clues like biomarkers is desperately needed as all available diagnostic methods require a sputum sample limiting applicability to patients with pulmonary disease who are able to provide sputum for analysis .
various molecules from mycobacterial as well as the host origin are being explored and tested for the same to get the desired speed , accuracy , and consistency in diagnosing the disease and restricting it for the benefit of patient and their environment .
in addition to the biomarkers used in the currently available diagnostic tests , the literature is rich with candidate biomarkers like early secretary proteins such as early secretory antigenic 6 kda ( esat-6 ) and culture filtrate protein 10 ( cfp-10 ) , malate synthase , etc . , and a few molecules emerging from the host in response to infection with varying degrees of validation with the potential for development into new diagnostic tests.[4346 ] the emergence of new knowledge about interactions of m. tuberculosis with its host with the advancing technology has provided new concepts of the clinical phenotypes , pathogenesis , and host immune responses in tuberculosis and the resulting opportunities for biomarker discovery .
the use of  omics  approaches may be needed for biomarker discovery in individuals who are exposed but not infected , who get infected but do not get the disease and in comparing them with those who succumb to the infection .
also , it is expected that these new biomarkers would be able to differentiate between active and latent tuberculosis .
the  omics  approach involves fetching out the signatures from transcriptomic , proteomic , or metabolomic profiling .
hopefully , some biomarkers would provide us with a reliably consistent indication of infection and would help us detect the same before the infection proceeds to a level wherein we could easily detect afb in sputum or otherwise but late .
also , with a significantly higher number of hiv patients ( 2.3 million prevalent cases ) , it complicates the management of tb in hiv - infected individuals . with about 50% lifetime risk of developing tb disease in hiv - infected people ,
it is projected that 50%60% of the hiv - infected persons in india will develop tb disease during their lifetime .
comparable data from various indian studies conducted between 1994 and 2006 also report the prevalence of hiv  tb co - infection in the range of 3%55% .
scientific efforts have been put in by academia and research institutes in india for the development of better diagnostic tools .
india has been a big market for in vitro diagnostics but has been dominated by imported and generic products , mostly serological , with virtually no innovations .
examples of the development in the field of hepatitis and others from the indian industry have given a hope that indian diagnostic companies could also become world 's hub for high - quality generic diagnostics in the field of tb diagnostics .
for this to happen , the indian industry needs to venture into genuine innovation in the field .
this requires supportive policies , enhanced and timely funding , and greater collaboration between the workers and the funders from the public and private sector .
rntcp , being an official caretaker in india for tb control , has been very active in the recent past . in line with the who 12-point policy package
, rntcp has also adopted strategies to diagnose and manage tb in hiv - infected patients .
the program has immediate priorities of restricting tb infection by providing treatment to all infected individuals . for diagnosis , there exist the guidelines for intensive case finding at the community level , but for early diagnosis of tb in the indian population , not many efforts could be made .
this is very justifiable in light of huge numbers of already existing cases of tb .
indian council of medical research ( icmr ) has also been working extensively on disease control programs with a support of the continued exploitation of scientific and technological advances from basic to applied research , from biomedical to health sciences , and from laboratory to field research .
icmr is providing significant information through its laboratories engaged in tb research and also provides funding to various academic and research institutions for research in this area .
they are not only discussing the problem and its solutions among themselves , but also consulting the international community for disseminating their work and getting updates from all over the world . an international symposium on tb diagnostics held at international centre for genetic engineering and biotechnology ( icgeb ) , new delhi , india , in december 2010 titled  innovating to make an impact  discussed multiple aspects regarding the challenges in tb diagnostics .
a very positive feel for support in the field of diagnostic development came out of this . a consultative meeting held in january 2011 at national aids research institute , india , on  galvanizing evidence for hiv management  also incorporated a full session on tb supported by who .
policy makers , subject experts , program implementers , researchers , hiv and tb physicians from different parts of india , researchers from another resource - limited setting like south africa , and researchers from usa took part in the discussions .
exclusive discussions on diagnosing extra - pulmonary tb , childhood tb , and hiv  tb were conducted as these pose serious challenges to developing universally applicable diagnostic tools for tb . the willingness and determination for better diagnosis and management of tb from laboratory workers to the policy makers
this systematic review has not tried to incorporate the strategy of meta - analysis as the reports or publications being considered here are not sufficient to cover the entire range of efforts being contributed .
recently , private enterprises are putting in a lot for the development of newer and better diagnostic tools in the field of tb .
but the data from this end are not available to statistically assemble the results of studies into a single estimate .
although the review has not taken into view all upcoming and sophisticated technologies which are not evidence based , the aim is to land upon an idea of basic problems being identified in due course of diagnostic development .
table 1 reviews the frequently used techniques , problems associated with them , and an approach to solve these problems .
also , in normal diagnostic settings which use conventional methods of diagnosis , it is always difficult to maintain quality and ensuring biosafety in the absence of recommended equipments . in a very recent policy recommendation by who
, a warning has been issued against the use of inaccurate blood tests for active tb , and these tests have been defined as 
substandard tests with unreliable results .  who has advised most of the countries which use these methods to ban the inaccurate and unapproved blood tests and instead rely on accurate microbiological or molecular tests , as recommended by who .
as there is a big market for these tests in india , the focus is now going to be toward alternatives which can be placed in the market for active tb diagnosis .
this is going to generate a huge demand of better diagnostic methods . in the light of a recent report 
totally drug resistant tuberculosis in india ,  followed by a big controversy about the origin and proper identification ,
it becomes indispensible for a clinician to confirm about the status of infecting species along with the exact nature of drug resistance . at the same time
, a clinician can not wait for culture - based reports to initiate the treatment .
in such cases , pcr / marker - based techniques would help getting concrete evidences of the etiology and would direct the treatment options on the right track .
overview of diagnostic methods and their limitations looking on the other side , wherein commercial automated liquid cultures are recommended for better quality with minimum handling and manipulation of cultures by laboratory technicians , the expense and sophistication required is not a bearable load for all . in such conditions ,
alternative and novel culture - based approaches with a justifiable balance of cost , biosafety , and sensitivity are highly solicited .
nucleic acid amplification test ( naat)-based methods seem to be the best and fastest options among all . the big question that arises then is how to facilitate the required resources .
we need to upgrade all research and diagnostic units all over the affected regions of the world to equip themselves with basic set - ups of pcr assays and to make confirmative diagnosis a routine and feasible option . in designing assays ,
sometimes the worker is faced with a significant challenge in selecting the primer and probe combinations that detect all of the organisms to cover a broader range of significant organisms , avoiding cross - reactivity , sequence analysis , etc .
anticipation and removal of inhibitory substances from the samples before the assay set - up is also a major issue to consider . for this , basic knowledge and training about molecular assays can be made a part of the basic training for technicians and scientists working in the field .
also naa tests are not considered for the evaluation of patients receiving therapy as the technology can not distinguish between live and dead organisms .
this can still be used with the same specificity if followed by short - term culture - based enrichment .
a possibility of having some method that incorporates both culture and modern methods of detection has been visualized during this review . a culture enriching the initial viable loads followed by a sensitive and specific naa test with a minimized need of containment can make identification safer , faster , and more reliable . with the recent enthusiasm of various policy makers , funding agencies , and grants ,
the need is now to foster innovations that deliver better tools to diagnose tb with confidence using affordable approaches .
after this only , the next step to treat and eradicate the menace of tb and associated risks can be taken with confidence .
this review has been written with an intention to make readers aware of the kind of methodological challenges involved in such diagnosis .
the author hopes that this will raise inquisitiveness in the brains of true scientific warriors to strive for newer ideas in making things simple and affordable ."	" tuberculosis ( tb ) has been a disease affecting almost all parts of the world since ages . 
 lot many efforts came in the past for improving diagnosis and treatment . 
 also , an effective vaccine has been sought after for long . with the emergence of resistant strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causal organisms of tuberculosis , and complexities emerging due to other associated infections and disease conditions 
 , there is a desperate need for further research input in the field . 
 be it the better medication and care or better resistance management , proper diagnostics holds the key to success . 
 it has been observed that a high burden of the disease was accompanied by resource limitations and poor research set - up . 
 the scenario remained like this for several decades . with the refreshed vision of resourceful countries and funding agencies , 
 funding is being provided in many areas of research in tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment . 
 this review has been written with an aim to bring forth the limitations of available methods in the field of diagnostics and making researchers aware about the changing scenario with better funding opportunities and support . 
 the author visualizes an enthusiasm from all over the world for the development of better modalities and urges scientists to join the struggle at this very perfect time to take the challenge and come forward with innovations in this field . "	"INTRODUCTION
SMEAR MICROSCOPY

THE INDIAN PERSPECTIVE
CONCLUSIONS"
65	"interferon- ( ifn- )  is an essential cytokine for immunity against intracellular pathogens and cancer .
mice with targeted disruptions of the ifng gene or ifng gene receptor 1 are highly susceptible to a variety of bacteria , protozoans , and virus infection .
furthermore , when mice lacking sensitivity to ifn- were challenged with chemical carcinogens , they developed tumor more rapidly and with higher frequency than wild type animals [ 2 , 3 ] . ifn- is produced by cells that mediate both innate and adaptative immune responses .
natural killer ( nk ) and natural killer t ( nkt ) cells are the innate cells sources of this cytokine and rapidly produce ifn- upon activation . on the other hand significant increase in ifn- expression by cd4 t lymphocytes is observed only after t helper ( th ) 1 differentiation .
in fact , upon activation , cd4 t cells can differentiate into several effector lineages , of which th1 is the only one that produce high levels of ifn-. nave cd8 t lymphocytes do not produce large amounts of ifn- , but after tcr stimulation these cells undergo differentiation into cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) and memory cells , which are capable of producing high levels of this cytokine in response to tcr activation or interleukin- ( il- ) 12 and il-18 .
the best characterized role of ifn- in cd8 t cell immunity is in enhancing class i antigen presentation pathway , which facilitates cytotoxic t cells to recognize infected cells .
ifn- signaling upregulation leads to expression of mhc class i and the tap transporter , as well as chaperones such as tapasin .
ifn- also induces a replacement of the constitutive proteasome subunits , 1 , 2 and 5 , for the immunoproteasome subunits lmp2 , mecl-1 , and lmp7 , an essential feature for increasing the quantity and repertoire of peptides presented in the context of class i mhc ( reviewed in ) .
ifn- also plays an important role in cd8 t cell homeostasis that is independent from its function in clearance of infection .
several studies have suggested that ifn- is a key determinant of immunodominance [ 68 ] .
badovinac and colleagues   have shown that ifn- deficient mice infected with an attenuated listeria monocytogenes strain exhibited an altered immunodominance hierarchy due to an increased expansion of cd8 t cells specific for a subdominant epitope of l. monocytogenes .
furthermore , ifn- seems to be required for subdominant cd8 t cells response suppression by dominant cd8 t cell response   and the cd8 t cells that promptly produce ifn- after stimulation are preferentially expanded .
this cytokine is important for the differentiation of tcrcd4cd8 intraepithelial lymphocytes ( iels ) in the gut .
iels are lymphocytes considered  activated yet resting  and their regulation is crucial role in the maintenance of the epithelial cell barrier and gut physiological inflammation .
ifn- also acts directly on cd8 t cells by stimulating their abundance in an acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( lcmv ) infection   and enhancing the development of memory cells .
interestingly , sercan and colleagues   show that ifn- produced by innate immune cells contributes to antigen - specific cd8 t cell homeostasis .
however , badovinac and colleagues   also have shown that ifn- deficiency resulted in a delayed contraction of antigen - specific cd8 t cell populations from both listeria monocytogenes and lcmv infections , which suggests an important role of this cytokine in control of death phase of antigen - specific cd8 t cells .
therefore , this cytokine has both positive and negative effects on cd8 t cell abundance depending on the phase of the cd8 response and also the biology model evaluated .
this dual role is clearly evident in ifn- deficient mice , in which both the expansion and contraction of cd8 t cell response are impaired .
cd8 t cells are usually characterized by their cytolytic activities involving perforin or fas mechanisms to kill targeted cells . however
cytokine secretion by cd8 t cells also has an important role in the control of intracellular infections . in 1990 ,
fong and mosmann   suggested that th1 cells and cd8 t cells could share cytokine mediated functions , like combating intracellular pathogens and tumors cells .
they observed that alloreactive murine cd8 t cell clones produced both mrna and protein profile characteristic of th1 clones , which include high levels of ifn-. it is well known that the clearance of several infections also depends on noncytolytic functions of cd8 t cells . the control of m. tuberculosis infections in mice requires the ability of the cd8 t cells to produce ifn- .
furthermore , ifn- produced by cd8 t cells is essential to clear numerous viral infections such as measles virus , herpes simplex virus type 1 , lcmv , and borna disease virus .
this ifn- mediated response seems to be important to avoid tissue damage and inflammation , which is normally observed in cytotoxic cd8 t cell response ( reviewed in ) .
indeed , hiv control is associated with polyfunctional cd8 t cells , that is , epitope - specific cells expressing several effector functions , which includes the expression of cytokines such as tnf and ifn- .
the ifn- produced by cd8 t cells seems to have other immunomodulatory roles , acting on cd4 t cells and b cells and also on cd8 t cells themselves .
the differentiation of cd4 t cells in t helper subsets depends on the cytokine milieu where these primary t cells were stimulated .
the main sources of these cytokines are activated innate immune cells . for th1 differentiation ,
the cytokines il-12 , produced by apcs , and ifn- , mainly produced by nk cells , are critical to induce and reinforce th1 commitment .
several studies have also suggested that cd8 t lymphocytes could have a role in the generation of th1 immunity and in the inhibition of th2 response [ 1820 ] .
uzonna and colleagues   have shown that ifn- produced by murine cd8 t cells , in response to low doses of l. major , downregulates an initial th2 response and enhances th1 commitment .
data from our group suggest that , besides nk and dendritic cells , cd8 t lymphocytes are also another source of ifn- that enhances cd4 th1 phenotype development .
we have shown that , after tcr activation of primary lymph node cells , cd8 t lymphocytes are the major source of ifn- production .
furthermore , cd4 t cells cocultured with ifn--competent cd8 t cells clearly produce more ifn- and less il-4 than cd4 t cells cultured with ifn--deficient cd8 t cells .
this work also suggested that nfat1 transcription factor - dependent ifn- production by cd8 t cell is important during eosinophil migration to pleura in a pleurisy model , which suggests an important role for ifn- produced by cd8 t cells in the control of allergic diseases .
together these studies reinforce the role of ifn- produced by cd8 t cells in regulation of th immune responses in vivo .
the autocrine ifn- signaling is important for th1 differentiation , and recently it has been suggested that ifn- is an autocrine / paracrine factor to promote nave t cd8 cell differentiation .
low levels of ifn- produced by cd8 t cells promote the upregulation of t - bet , granzyme b , and ifn- also promotes a week cytolytic activity .
ifn- alone does not support strong differentiation but can synergize with ifn- in driving effector differentiation of these cd8 t cells .
a previous paper has also shown that nave cd8 t cells receive an ifn- signal few hours after l. monocytogenes infection .
these studies suggest that the ifn- signals for cd8 t cell differentiation are delivered early in the immune response .
when nave t cd4 and cd8 cells are compared for the ifn- production , it is clear that , after tcr activation , cd8 t cells produce more levels of ifn- than cd4 t cells , and the requirements for tcr induced ifn- production are different between these primary cells . in fact , carter and murphy   have shown that cd4 t cells require stat4 activation beside tcr signalization to produce ifn- , while cd8 t cells need only tcr activation .
furthermore , the main difference in transcriptional requirements for ifng expression between cd4 and cd8 t cells seems to be the differential role of members of the t - box family of transcription factors , t - bet and eomesodermin ( eomes ) .
t - bet is the master regulator of ifng and th1 commitment of cd4 t cells   and sufficient for induction of ifng expression in these cells . on the other hand ,
additionally , eomes and t - bet play important roles during cd8 t cell differentiation to effector and memory t cells , where t - bet is associated with effector phenotype whereas expression of eomes increases in memory cd8 t cells .
there are several studies about ifn- production by th1 cells and the molecular mechanisms that control ifng expression in these cells
are widely investigated and extensively reviewed . however , regulation of ifng expression in cd8 t cells is not fairly explored and discussed .
an effective cellular immune response is characterized by robust stimulation of nave lymphocytes to undergo differentiation into effector cells , which provides pathogen clearance while promoting the development of long - lived memory cells that can respond to reinfection faster than nave cells .
the cd8 differentiation is accompanied by large - scale changes in the coordinate expression of genes associated with effector function , survival , and self - renewal   and recently it has been recognized that epigenetic modification is an integral part of this process .
this section will focus on the chromatin status of ifng promoter in cd8 t cells .
however , due to the scarcity of studies exploring cd8 t cells and the higher availability of data investigating cd4 t cells , some aspects of cd4 regulation will be mentioned for comparison .
differential gene expression can be regulated from the selective action of transcriptional factors and also from epigenetic mechanisms , such as dna methylation or posttranslational histone modifications .
these epigenetic modifications could be heritable and occur without affecting the dna sequence , which makes the epigenetic information potentially plastic .
it is the whole set of epigenetic modifications at a given locus , including the interaction of atp - dependent nucleosomal remodeling complexes with dna methylation and histone modifications that play a key role in regulating gene expression and chromatin organization .
methylation of cytosine residues within cpg dinucleotides is an efficient epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing .
the methyl group addition at the 5 carbon of the pyrimidine ring of cytosine is catalyzed by enzymes called dna methyltransferases ( dnmts ) .
dna methylation in the vicinity of transcriptional start sites results in repression and gene silencing by direct and indirect mechanisms .
the direct mechanism is done by affecting the binding of transcription factors that do not recognize methylated cpg sites .
these proteins prevent the binding of transcription factors to dna and can recruit several enzymes that catalyze transcriptionally silent histone modifications and other factors that make the chromatin more compact and consequently less accessible to transcription machinery .
the importance of cpg methylation for ifng expression is supported by experiments of cd8 t cell cultures stimulated via tcr in the presence of 5-azacytidine ( 5-aza ) , a drug that causes dna demethylation upon proliferation . upon aza treatment , increased levels of this cytokine in culture supernatants were described , as well as an increment in the number of nave cells able to produce ifn- when compared to control .
several genomic regions could be involved in this regulation and a possible role of ifng mouse promoter was particularly investigated .
numeration of these sites varies among different publications , but here we will denominate it according to the initial transcription site from the refseq sequence identifier nm_008337 .
cd8 t cell clonal analysis of ifng promoter methylation by bisulfite genomic dna sequencing and mrna expression by quantitative competitive pcr ( qcpcr ) revealed an overall association between demethylation of ifn- promoter and expression of mrna .
cpg sites located at 212 , 198 , and 58 were methylated in most ifn--negative mrna clones and their demethylation was closely related to ifn- expression .
however , there is a clonal heterogeneity , with clone- and site - specific differences across the promoter .
interestingly much more variability was observed when clones derived from nave cd8cd44 t cells were assayed .
on the other hand , most of the cpg sites in ifng promoter of clones derived from cd8cd44 t cells were demethylated and these clones expressed high levels of ifn-. in line with that winders and colleagues   showed by southern blot analysis with methylation - sensitive enzymes that ifn- promoter is mostly unmethylated at the 301 , 212 , and 58 sites in cd8 t cells from ot - i mice .
similar patterns were observed in cd4 t cells from 5c.c7 mice , and earlier stages of t cell development also revealed hypomethylation at the 212 to 50 cpg sites .
but the upstream site 380 was hypermethylated in both double positive and double negative thymocytes . in accord with the hypothesis that cpg methylation occurs in ifn- nonproducers ,
also , stimulation of cd4 t cells in th2 polarizing conditions leads to a pronounced increase of methylation at particular sites .
kersh and colleagues   performed by bisulfite sequencing an ex vivo analysis of nave and in vivo generated effector and memory cd8 t cells from p14 tcr - transgenic mice , which are specific for gp33 - 41 epitope of lcmv glycoprotein .
but these cells have posttranscriptional sites ( + 12 , + 91 , and + 114 ) mainly methylated .
although the average numbers of methyl - cpg sites in nave and memory cells were the same ( 2.8 and 2.7 , resp . )
similar to data from northrop and colleagues , effector cd8 cells had a completely unmethylated promoter .
the discrete differences in dna methylation between nave and memory cd8 cells may represent a differential regulation in these cell types , because after 5 hours of antigenic - stimulation , a demethylation independent of dna replication was observed in memory cells , but this is not true for nave p14 cells .
furthermore , treatment of nave p14 cells with 5-aza led to an increase in the number of cells able to produce ifn- , and no difference was observed when memory cells were used suggesting that ifng is silenced by dna methylation in nave , but not cd8 , memory cells .
not only the number but also the amount of intracellular ifn- produced by nave p14 cells treated with 5-aza has increased , when compared to control . in line with that ,
makar and wilson   reported that when nave cd8 t cells deficient in the maintenance dnmt 1 ( dnmt1 ) are stimulated for 3 days they increase ifng expression 510-fold after restimulation .
but it is important to note that even in dnmt1 deficient mice the ifn- production is higher in cd8 than cd4 lymphocytes , suggesting that maintenance of ifn- expression in specific t cell subsets is not dependent on cpg methylation . in opposition ,
th2-related cytokines ( il-4 , il-5 , and il-13 ) were significantly expressed only when cd8 t cells lacks dnmt1 .
the other study characterizing cpg methylation of ifn- promoter in several cell types investigated the methylation status of the 212 , 198 , 178 , 58 , 50 , 39 , + 12 , and + 91 cpg sites .
all the cpgs were almost completely methylated in kidney and heart tissues , and entirely unmethylated in nk cells .
consistent with other reports [ 32 , 33 ] , cpgs located at untranscribed regions were hypomethylated and those at transcribed regions were hypermethylated in cd8 nave cells from c57/bl6 mice .
although a different mouse lineage was used to obtain memory cd8 t cells , they presented 06% and 3070% methylation in untranscribed and transcribed region , respectively .
as previously reported , earlier stages of t cell development ( dn , dp , cd4 , and cd8 thymocytes ) have also hypomethylated cpg sites at ifn- promoter .
cd4 t lymphocytes from the same mice presented a similar cpg methylation pattern of c57/bl6 cd8 nave cells , but polarization to th1 results in a significant level of demethylation in transcribed region .
like other reports , th2 underwent some level of methylation at untranscribed region , with the position 58 being more methylated than other promoter sites , while no detectable change was observed when differentiation occurred at neutralizing conditions ( th0 ) .
taken together , all these data suggest that nave cd8 t cells exhibit a low methylation profile in untranscribed region and a hypermethylation in transcribed region , and , following tcr stimulation , methylation decreases in both regions .
the functional significance of ifn- promoter cpg methylation was assayed by luciferase reporter assays showing that methylation of the whole ifn- promoter vector inhibits its transcriptional activity [ 33 , 36 ] .
methylation of the 212 , 198 , and 178 sites individually did not affect the activity of ifng promoter , and little effect was observed when the 50 and 39 sites were exclusively methylated , but modification of 58 cpg site significantly reduced the activity to a level similar to that of the observed for the completely methylated vector .
interestingly , methylation of 58 site occurred faster and more completely than the other sites during th1 and th2 polarization , but a more accentuated outcome was observed in th2 [ 33 , 36 ] .
the versatile profile of the 58 site could potentially interfere with transcription . the use of oligonucleotide probes with methylated 58 cpg , but not 50 and 39 , abolished the formation of 2 complexes verified when unmethylated probes were used in emsa with nuclear extracts of th1 cell line ae7 . in supershift assays
c - jun and atf2 were identified in the upper band and creb and atf1/creb in the lower one , and this was also observed when th2 nuclear extracts from d10 lineage were used .
chromatin immunoprecipitation ( chip ) assays confirmed the creb and creb / atf1 binding and identified fosb , junb , c - jun , and atf2 interacting with ifn- promoter in th1 cell lineage in vivo . concerning the th2 cell lineage ,
the mentioned functional and binding assays were performed in th cells , and although they are related to cd8 lymphocytes , several data suggest that ifng regulation may have particular characteristics in each t cell subset , like data obtained from transgenic mice model which express the luciferase gene under the control of proximal ( 70 to 44 ) and distal ( 98 to 78 ) regulatory elements from the ifn- promoter . in vitro
primed cd4 t cells express reporters under control of both elements , while cd8 cells do so only under the distal element .
in addition , elevated cyclic amp inhibited transcriptional activity directed by the proximal regulatory element in primed cd4 + t cells but enhanced transcriptional activity directed by the distal in primed cd8 + t cells .
this differential gene expression depends on the selective action of transcriptional factors , but also from epigenetic modifications that could change the chromatin accessibility to transcriptional machinery .
depending on both covalent modification type and the modified residue , these modifications could result in gene activation or silencing .
( ach3 and ach4 , resp . ) and methylation of lysine 4 of histone h3 are histone modifications associated with poised or transcriptionally active genes . on the other hand , trimethylation of lysines 9 or 27 of histone h3
in fact , reduced repressive h3k27me3 and h3k27me2 throughout ifng after primary infection and persistence in memory cd8 t lymphocytes was reported , as well as a detection of minor h3k4me3 peaks near ifng tss in effector and memory t cd8 cells .
in addition to the loss of dna methylation at ifn- promoter in the differentiation of nave p14 cd8 t cells to effector , northrop and colleagues   reported a more pronounced demethylation of the ifn- enhancer at the first intron .
investigation of ach3 by chip and detection by real - time pcr revealed a significant increase in ifn- promoter after stimulation , and similar increase was observed in the comparison of nave cd8 t cells with effector and memory cd8 t cells in promoter and enhancer . nevertheless , when cd8 memory and effector cells were generated in cd4 deficient mice ( b6 cd4 ) , they produced  considerably 
less ifn- per cell and the shift in histone acetylation is no longer seen , suggesting that demethylation of cpg sites within ifn- promoter and enhancer in cd8 effector and memory cells occurred independently of cd4 t help , while histone acetylation at these same regions was highly dependent upon the presence of cd4 help .
this effect is cytokine specific , because hypoacetylation of il-2 does not change in differentiated cd8 cells .
although the above data suggest that epigenetic regulation of the ifng promoter may interfere in its expression , transgenes containing the 8.6-kb fragment of human genomic dna containing the full length ifn- gene ( promoter , introns , and up to 3.4  kb of 5 flanking sequence ) do not confer proper t cell subset - specific expression in vivo [ 4143 ] .
indeed , a transgenic model containing the human ifng gene and 9095  kb of flanking sequence results in high - level , th1-specific ifn- production . therefore , the search for conserved noncoding sequences ( cns ) among different species has been proved as a good method for identification of relevant cis - regulatory elements for ifn- gene . 
 in silico searches for cnss across human , mouse , and rat genomes allowed the identification of 2 sequences located at 5.27  kb [ 44 , 45 ] and 17.36  kb of murine ifng translational start site .
the first one is referred to as cns-1 or ifn- 5 cns and the second , cns-2 .
both of them exhibited enhancer like function in luciferase reporter assays in response to ionomycin in t cell lineages and correspond to a dnase i hypersensitive site in th1 cells but not in th2 cells [ 44 , 45 ] .
similar pattern of ach3 ( and more slightly ach4 ) and h3k4me2 is observed in cd8 and th1 cells , which are good sources of ifn- [ 40 , 44 ] .
interestingly , despite the fact that in vitro primed effector cd8 t cells have more levels of ach3 at intron 3 compared to cns-1 , tcr tg effector cd8 t cells primed in vivo displayed greater ach3 at cns-1 compared to intron 3 . increased levels of mentioned modifications were detected at promoter , intron 3 , and cns-2 regions while th2 has more discrete peaks .
interestingly , h3ac chip analysis of th1 , th2 , and cd8 cells from mice deficient in t - bet revealed that this transcription factor is required for induction of histone modifications in th1 , but not t cd8 cells . despite some similarities between cd4 and cd8 t lymphocytes ,
cd8 cells seem to have particular regulation of ifn  production . therefore , more research is needed to characterize possible pathways engaged in this control .
hatton and colleagues   identified a cns located at 22  kb from ifng that when deleted blocks ifng reporter expression in th1 and cd8 t cells .
transgenic mouse model also suggests that this element is required for ifn- expression in cd4 and cd8 t cells . in 2007 , schoenborn and colleagues   also performed a comparative genomic analysis that revealed eight highly conserved noncoding sequences ( cnss ) in a ~100  kb region surrounding ifng .
previously identified cns-1 ( also called cns-6 ) , 22 , 34 , 54 , and + 18/20 ( also called cns-2 ) were among them , but they further identify the cns+29 , + 46 , and + 55 . although the aim of the study was to characterize regulatory elements that govern ifng expression in cd4 t cells , functional elements identified were also investigated in primary cd8 t cells : cns-6 enhanced expression in stimulated cd8 cells as well as in th0 or th1 cells , but the authors report that cns-34 did so only in cd8 . on the other hand , cns22 enhanced expression in response to il-12 plus il-18 in th0 and th1 cells , but this effect was not consistently evident in cd8 + t cells .
these results suggest that some sequences like cns-22 may be necessary for ifng expression in both cd4 and cd8 t cells , while others , as cns-34 , may have regulatory role only in cd8 t lymphocytes .
moreover , more studies are needed to explore cnss functions and epigenetic marks in cd8 t cells .
there are relatively concordant data concerning cpg methylation of ifng promoter , but fewer studies investigated the status of other relevant sequences for ifn- expression in cd8 lymphocytes .
there is also a relative lack of data concerning other epigenetic marks , as histone modifications , and the interplay between factors that may determine or influence this status in cd8 t cells .
it would be of particular interest to investigate if epigenetic events can influence heterogeneous features of cd8 t cell populations , like the capacity of polyfunctional cells to express several cytokines , and if specific microenvironments could modulate the ifng expression through epigenetic marks , as in iels .
these observations reinforce that more studies are needed to understand the transcriptional regulation of ifng in cd8 t cell lineage ."	" interferon- ( ifn- )  is an essential cytokine for immunity against intracellular pathogens and cancer . 
 ifn- expression by cd4 t lymphocytes is observed only after t helper ( th ) 1 differentiation and there are several studies about the molecular mechanisms that control ifng expression in these cells . 
 however , nave cd8 t lymphocytes do not produce large amounts of ifn- , but after tcr stimulation there is a progressive acquisition of ifn- expression during differentiation into cytotoxic t lymphocytes ( ctl ) and memory cells , which are capable of producing high levels of this cytokine . 
 differential gene expression can be regulated from the selective action of transcriptional factors and also from epigenetic mechanisms , such as dna cpg methylation or posttranslational histone modifications . 
 recently it has been recognized that epigenetic modification is an integral part of cd8 lymphocyte differentiation . 
 this review will focus on the chromatin status of ifng promoter in cd8 t cells and possible influences of epigenetic modifications in ifng gene and conserved noncoding sequences ( cnss ) in regulation of ifn- production by cd8 t lymphocytes . "	"1. Interferon- (IFN-)

 blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome ( brbns ) or bean s syndrome is a disorder characterized by distinctive vascular malformations that mostly involve cutaneous and gastrointestinal tract .occult bleeding and iron deficiency anemia ( ida ) are the most common clinical presentation of brbns but melena , hematochezia and involvement of internal organs has also been reported.1 , 
 2it is a very rare syndrome and only about 200 cases have been reported till 2012 . 
 
 here
, we report a case of brbns that present with ida . to the best of our knowledge

 a 22 years old man was referred to the gi clinic of afzalpour hospital for evaluation of ida .
history of abdominal pain , prolonged diarrhea and/or constipation , vomiting , flatulence and prolonged fever were negative .
he suffered from a vascular mass on right supraclavicular region at birth with gradual enlargement . at the childhood , surgical resection of the mass
was performed and histology showed irregular cavernous channels in both cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue compatible with venous malformation . at the age of 15 , oral iron intake was started because of ida . at about the same time , multiple bluish colored nodular lesions appeared on his lower extremities .
he was not drug abuser and drug history included only oral and intravenous iron supplementation since 7 years ago . in physical examination
these nodules measured from 0.5 to 1.5 cm and tended to refill after compression . scar of a previous incision was present on the right supraclavicular region ( figure2 ) .
upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy along with duodenal biopsy had been performed 4 years ago and was normal.serum immunoglobulin a(ig a ) and anti - tissue transglutaminase antibody ( ttg ) -ig a levels were also normal
. 
 
 in our center the patient underwent upper and lower gi endoscopy for second time . in upper endoscopy , a bluish vascular lesion with 10
mm diameter and wrinkled surface was seen in proximal part of duodenum ( figure3-a).colonoscopy also revealed a similar lesion in the descending part of colon ( figure3-b ) .
3-a ( left ) shows a bluish vascular lesion with wrinkled surface in proximal part of duodenum .

 important diseases that involve the skin and gastrointestinal tract with vascular malformations include brbns , mafucci s syndrome and osler - weber- rendu syndrome . however , rendu - osler - weber syndrome is an inherited autosomal dominant condition and these patients often experience recurrent episodes of epistaxis with telangiectasia in histologic examination   and patients with mafucci s syndrome also have bone malformations and chondrodysplasias . 
 

a diagnosis of brbns was made on the basis of the typical skin lesions which were rubbery discrete compressible blebs increasing in number over the years , multiple bluish nevi in duodenum and colon on gi endoscopy , and histological picture of venous malformation on skin biopsy .
brbns ( or bean s syndrome ) is a rare disorder that is characterized by multiple recurrent vascular malformations that primarily involve the skin and the gastrointestinal tract .the disease and its association with hemagniomas in the skin and gastrointestinal tract was first reported in 1860 by gascoyen.a century later in 1958 , william bean named it as brbns . 
 

skin lesions in brbns are often first noticed at birth or in the neonatal period , but can present later .the size ranges from a few millimeters to many centimeters .
three types of skin lesions have been described .the most common type is red to blue , nipple - like skin lesion that is easily compressible and refills slowly on release of pressure .
this is an important diagnostic sign .the skin lesions in this case were also small , bluish , soft and compressible , and they occurred in the upper and lower extremities ; these are the typical features of brbns . 
 

the gastrointestinal tract is the most common organ involved in this disorder , small bowel and distal colon are predominantly affected .
bleeding from vascular malformations in gasterointestinal tract often cause ida that is the most common clinical manifestation of brbns but rarely presented as melena or hematochezia.1 , 
 2 in endoscopy , the mucosal nodules are either flat , polypoid or have central bluish nipples.1 , 
 7 in our case , the gastrointestinal lesions were limited to two protuberant lesions with wrinkled surface in duodenum and distal part of colon . 
 
 rarely , involvement of other internal organs occurs and can result in hemothorax , hemopericardium , pulmonary hypertension and central nervous system symptoms . 
 

often , brbns develops sporadically , but sometimes is inherited as an autosomal dominant pattern and its association with chromosome 9p has already been established .our case seems to have developed sporadically because no family member had history of brbns . 
 
 in most cases ,
only asymptomatic skin lesions are present and patients have a normal life span without any malignant transformation .
gi bleeding and rarely , central nervous system involvement can befatal and skeletal lesions are able to cause functional and physical inability .
intussusceptions , volvulus , and bowel infarction should be considered in patient with brbns and abdominal pain . 
 

the treatment of brbns is mainly conservative . when the patient is asymptomatic and only has mild anemia , observation and iron supplements are adequate.1- 
 3 
 
 several therapeutic modalities have been attempted to date for treating brbns .
antiangiogenetic agents such as steroids , interferon -2a and octreotide have been applied to reduce the frequency and severity of bleeding episodes.unfortunately , in most cases , discontinuing administration of these medical treatments has led to recurrence of the disease . 
 

although endoscopic laser photocoagulation , sclerosis , band ligation and polypectomy have been successfully utilized , they may be dangerous in transmural lesions . 
 

laparatomy with intraoperative endoscopy may be the best approach for patients with refractory anemia and multiple lesions in gi tract especially small bowel.15- 
 20 in the largest study on treatment of brbns published so far , ten patients with brbns and ida with prior history of at least one blood transfusion , underwent whole gi endoscopy .
subsequent gastrointestinal bleeding recurred in only one patient who had received less extensive procedures . 
 

our patient was consulted about the natural history of the disease and the chronicity of the condition which is disabling but not fatal in majority of cases .
he did well during 2 years of follow up and his hemoglobin level was maintained without any need to transfusions .
long term follow up is required to evaluate the effect of conservative treatment with iron supplementation in this patient and determine surgical intervention will be necessary or not . 
"	" 
 blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a rare disorder that is characterized by multiple recurrent vascular malformations of skin and gastrointestinal tract . 
 the affected patients may present with diverse manifestations including iron deficiency anemia . 

 
 we report this syndrome in a 22-year - old man that was referred to our hospital for iron deficiency anemia with unknown cause and vascular malformations in the skin and gastrointestinal tract . because of stable hemoglobin level 
 , we decided to treatment him by iron supplementation and close follow up . 
 we report this case along with a review of literature .

CASE REPORT


DISCUSSION


CONFLICT OF INTEREST
"
67	"concurrence of more than one disease in the liver ( thereafter  overlap ) may have a significant impact on disease progression . due to a progressive increase in the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( nafld ) associated with 
endemic obesity , overlapped nafld , especially in its necroinflammatory form of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) , has gained clinical relevance in the diagnosis and prognosis of chronic liver disease .
in fact , patients with chronic hepatitis c and nash have more advanced stages of fibrosis accompanied by more severe metabolic syndrome than those with chronic hepatitis c or chronic hepatitis c and nonalcoholic steatosis .
regarding overlap with other forms of chronic liver disease , nash - autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) overlap syndrome has received special attention for several reasons .
first , histological diagnosis of nash - aih overlap is absolutely required , owing to previous reports that autoantibodies were present in about one quarter of patients with nafld   and that without liver biopsy , almost all the female patients were incorrectly diagnosed with aih .
second , the optimum treatment regimen to achieve biochemical remission has been difficult to standardize ; corticosteroids are likely to worsen nash   but improve aih - related necroinflammation .
third , the natural course and postintervention prognosis remain to be characterized . to our knowledge
, 8 cases of biopsy - proven nafld - aih overlap syndrome have been reported to date [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] , 3 with nash and 5 with nafld ( the latter without detailed information on the presence of steatohepatitis ) . among these ,
2 cases of nash - aih overlap were treated with corticosteroid , but histological changes as revealed by follow - up liver biopsies have not yet been reported . in this report
we describe a patient with nash - aih overlap who successfully achieved histological remission of aih as well as resolution of nash with a combination of prednisolone therapy and weight loss .
this is the first report demonstrating that corticosteroids improve the prognosis of nash - aih overlap .
a 57-year - old female patient was referred to our hospital with a 2-year history of low - grade but gradually progressing aminotransferase elevation . on admission ,
clinical examination was normal but blood tests revealed elevated liver enzymes , i.e. , ast 174 iu / l ( normal < 37
iu / l ) , and -gtp 120 iu / l ( normal < 75 iu / l ) .
her serum autoantibody profile was as follows : anti - nuclear antibody 1,280 ( speckled ) , anti - smooth muscle antibody 80 , and anti - ss - a 64 , but anti - mitochondria antibody was negative .
serum igg was increased to 2,370 mg / dl ( normal < 1,700 mg / dl ) and human leukocyte antigen was found to be dr3/dr4 .
elevated fasting blood glucose ( 123 mg / dl ) coupled with increased hba1c ( 7.3% ) indicated comorbid diabetes mellitus .
the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance ( homa - r ) was 11.4 , though the patient was not significantly obese ( body mass index was 23.6 ) .
as abdominal ct scan and ultrasonography both suggested the presence of fatty liver , subsequent liver biopsy was required to narrow down the differential diagnosis that included nafld , aih , and their concurrence .
steatosis and pericellular / bridging fibrosis were also prominent , accompanied by hepatocyte ballooning , implicating concurrence with the histological features of steatohepatitis .
a diagnosis of nash - aih overlap was made ( aih score was 18 , i.e. , definite , together with nash grade 2/stage 3 according to the blunt classification system ) , and 30 mg of prednisolone per day p.o . was initiated .
prednisolone exacerbated the patient 's diabetes during the 1st week of treatment , necessitating the administration of rapid - acting insulin .
as aminotransferase levels began to decrease shortly after the initiation of treatment , prednisolone was gradually tapered to 15 mg / day over 6 months until liver enzymes normalized .
prednisolone was further tapered to 5 mg / day over the next 12 months , without any hepatitis flare - up .
was then added to prednisolone as maintenance therapy , and rapid - acting insulin was subsequently replaced with an oral hypoglycemic agent .
follow - up liver tissue examination performed 40 months after diagnosis revealed only minimal inflammatory infiltrates in the portal area without any histological evidence of steatohepatitis ( fig .
the fibrosis score established by ishak et al .   decreased from 4 at diagnosis to 1 , while the nafld activity score   ( scale developed by the nash clinical research network ) decreased from 6 to 2 .
in this report we present a nash - aih overlap patient who successfully achieved histological remission of both aih and nash following prednisolone therapy . to our knowledge , this report is the first to document the detailed clinical course of nash - aih overlap during prednisolone therapy , accompanied by documentation of histological improvement .
information regarding treatment regimen was presented in 6 out of 8 nafld - aih overlap cases in the literature [ 2 , 3 , 6 ] : 2 patients were given prednisolone combined with diet therapy , resulting in a partial biochemical response .
on the other hand , 1 out of 2 patients treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and modified diet was reported to show normalized aminotransferases .
the remaining 2 cases were not treated , in 1 case due to coexisting diabetes and dyslipidemia despite the presence of definite aih . due to the anti - inflammatory action of glucocorticoid , fibrosis in aih commonly
improves or does not progress during therapy [ 9 , 10 , 11 ] . reflecting glucocorticoids cell- and tissue - specific mode of action through the glucocorticoid receptor ,
persistently elevated glucocorticoid levels have been associated with fatty liver development and their consequent phenotype in nafld . moreover , dose - dependent association of glucocorticoid with secondary nash was demonstrated in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus , and hepatic fat accumulation has been documented in patients with cushing 's syndrome . in accordance with clinical findings ,
lemke et al .   recently reported that liver - specific glucocorticoid receptor knock - down by shrna , through induction of transcriptional repressor hairy enhancer of split 1 ( hes1 ) , caused a pronounced decrease in hepatic triglyceride levels in the livers of obese db / db mice .
the above findings raise concerns about the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of nafld - aih overlap . in our case the clinical benefit of prednisolone 's immunosuppressive and fibrolytic action clearly outweighed its steatogenic properties .
our findings thus emphasize the need of appropriate immunosuppressive treatment even in comorbid aih and nash , though interindividual differences and genetic susceptibility may affect the glucocorticoids steatogenic actions .
it should be noted that our study used a shorter duration and lower total dosage of prednisolone administration for aih compared to that for systemic lupus erythematosus , and this may not exacerbate concurrent nash if it is accompanied with appropriate diet therapy , the gold standard treatment for nash .
loria et al .   reported that 3 out of 84 nafld patients ( 3.6% ) were diagnosed with true nash - aih overlap after liver biopsy , whereas 1 out of 212 japanese nafld patients ( 0.5% ) had definite aih .
given ethnic differences in susceptibility to the development of nash - aih overlap , the increasing prevalence of nafld worldwide probably makes nash - aih overlap more clinically relevant .
obviously , the false diagnosis of overlapped aih in female nash patients who have not undergone liver biopsy should be avoided , but true diagnosis of nash - aih accompanied by appropriate corticosteroid induction is needed to prevent disease progression .
we presented a patient with nash - aih overlap who achieved histological remission as a result of prednisolone therapy .
future prospective studies and the accumulation of definite cases are needed to validate the effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy for nash - aih overlap ."	" concurrence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( nash ) with autoimmune hepatitis ( aih ) is a rare condition that is challenging to diagnosis , due to the relatively high prevalence of autoantibodies in nash . 
 it is also difficult to determine the most effective treatment as corticosteroids are likely to worsen nash despite being effective in the treatment of aih . in this case report , we present a female diagnosed with nash - aih overlap with accompanying diabetes mellitus , who successfully achieved normalization of serum alanine aminotransferase levels following prednisolone therapy and weight loss . 
 a follow - up liver biopsy performed 40 months after the initial diagnosis showed only minimal inflammatory infiltrates in the portal area without any nash histology . 
 resolution of nash , in conjunction with a reduction in hepatic fibrosis , might suggest that prednisolone itself does not aggravate steatohepatitis , but rather prevents disease progression . 
 appropriate immunosuppressive treatment may therefore be an important component of the optimum therapy for nash - aih overlap . "	"Introduction

70	"joubert syndrome is an autosomal recessive , neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from cerebellar and brainstem abnormalities .
this syndrome was first documented in 1969 in five children with episodic tachypnea , jerky eye movements , ataxia , mental retardation , and hypogenesis of the cerebellar vermis.1 magnetic resonance imaging revolutionized the diagnosis of joubert syndrome .
it revealed midbrain / hindbrain malformations including fourth ventricle dilatation and superior cerebellar peduncle elongation , which forms the classically described 
molar tooth sign.2 distortion in the eye and brainstem may cause several ocular manifestations of joubert syndrome , including leber s congenital amourosis , colobomas , and congenital retinal dystrophy.3 here , we describe one case of a variant form of joubert syndrome and adult - onset bilateral ptosis .
the 24-year - old female patient complained of double vision and the inability to open both eyes for the past 6 months .
the onset of the ptosis had slowly progressed , starting a year prior after the mother noticed her daughter s unequal pupils .
the mother reported that her daughter had twitching and gradual closure of her right eye that spread to the left eye within 6 months ( figure 1 ) .
the patient s past medical history is significant for premature birth at 28 weeks gestation with corpus callosum agenesis , cerebellar vermis agenesis , a molar tooth - like brainstem , and a cyst in her midbrain . in her first week of life
the patient received two ventriculoperitoneal shunts , one in the right frontal lateral ventricle and the other in the fourth ventricle .
she underwent multiple revisions of the shunts for occlusion , infection , and malfunction in 2002 , 2003 , and 2005 .
due to abnormal cerebral development , the patient had difficulties swallowing , total left hemiparesis , and spastic muscle tone .
ocular examination assessed the visual acuity , which was 20/80 for the left and right eye .
the patient had diplopia on primary gaze , complete closure of the right eye , and almost complete closure of the left eye .
an extraocular motility examination revealed bilateral upgaze and downgaze palsy and an abducens palsy of the left eye .
neurologic testing displayed spastic motor control and paraplegia , with the right side worse than the left .
the patient had a poor finger - to - nose test , with the left worse than the right .
a baseline magnetic resonance image of her brain 6 years prior to her first admission due to shunt malfunction revealed dysgenesis of the corpus callosum with colpocephaly , atrophy of the cerebellar vermis , and a large posterior interhemispheric cyst causing anterior displacement of the diencephalon and third ventricle .
the brainstem of the patient did not look like the classical  molar tooth sign .
a cystic lesion was located in the right cerebral peduncle , suggesting an entrapped section of the fourth ventricle .
after several revisions of both shunts , the frontal shunt tip was placed adjacent to the third ventricle in the region of the right foramen of monro , and the infratentorial shunt tip placed in the cerebral aqueduct .
a computed tomography scan of her head upon admission revealed that the cyst in the right cerebral peduncle had enlarged in size to 11.2 mm . due to her diplopia and bilateral ptosis ,
myasthenia gravis was considered . however , the anti - acetylcholine antibody level results and the ice test were within normal limits .
genetic testing was carried out in suspicion of dandy walker malformation , but the results revealed a normal female karyotype .
the patient was brought to the operating room for bilateral ptosis repair with silicone sling implants .
seiff slings ( seiff frontalis suspension et , beaver visitec , waltham , ma ) were inserted and tightened until the upper lid was at maximal height whilst still maintaining globe contact . on a follow - up appointment ,
the patient was able to open and close her eyes well with frontalis and orbicularis contraction , respectively ( figure 2 ) .
many ophthalmic features have been associated with joubert syndrome , such as saccadic dysfunction , primary nystagmus , strabismus , and ptosis.4 however , those features were exclusively described in children , whereas our patient developed bilateral ptosis as a young adult .
her ptosis and eye movement dysfunction could be a progression of her joubert syndrome , or possibly a complication of multiple ventriculoperitoneal shunting .
her late - onset ptosis could also be a complication of the fibrocystic changes in her midbrain from multiple ventriculoperitoneal shunting .
repeated shunting may also cause further dilatation of the aqueduct , which could disrupt the oculomotor nucleus located anterior to the cerebral aqueduct at the level of the superior colliculi.5 the enlarging midbrain cyst adjacent to the posterior shunt tip could also be the cause of her abnormal ocular motility and bilateral ptosis .
the abducens palsy of the left eye could be a sign of increased intracranial pressure from shunt malformation.6 however , we should have been able to identify papilledema in our patient .
there have been documented cases of increased intracranial pressure presenting with an isolated abducens palsy without papilledema.7 nystagmus is commonly found in joubert syndrome yet was absent in our patient .
congenital ocular fibrosis is characterized by the abnormal insertion and fibrosis of the extraocular muscles with ptosis and compensatory chin elevation , which could account for our patient s ocular findings .
however , the patient s extraocular muscles appeared normal without signs of fibrosis intraoperatively with forced duction testing .
she developed bilateral ptosis as an adolescent , and the cause of the ptosis is still unclear .
we present a rare case of central third nuclear ptosis secondary to joubert syndrome or perhaps its management of cerebrospinal fluid flow blockage .
to our knowledge , this is the first such case of adult - onset nuclear third nerve palsy in the presence of joubert syndrome described in the literature ."	" in this case report , we describe a case of adult - onset bulbar ptosis in a patient with joubert syndrome . 
 joubert syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder with malformations in cerebellum and brainstem . 
 many ocular abnormalities have been noted in joubert syndrome , but the association of this syndrome with adult - onset ptosis has not been described to date . 
 this 24-year - old joubert patient developed a cerebrospinal fluid cyst in her midbrain . 
 she had signs of bilateral third nerve palsy and abducens palsy in the left eye . 
 the bilateral central third nerve palsy causing functional blindness secondary to severe bilateral levator palsy was treated successfully with silicone sling frontalis suspension , as the seventh nerve nucleus was not involved . "	"Introduction

72	"breslau and associates estimated the lifetime prevalence of physical assault in the united states to be 8.3% for both genders .
other studies have reported lifetime rates of physical assault from 7% to 12% for women and from 10% to 19% in males.[25 ] although the risk for assault exists in all ethnic , racial , and socioeconomic classes , certain demographic groups experience disproportionate rates of physical violence .
several studies show racial disparities exist among victims of assault.[246 ] amstadter and associates showed african americans were two - fold as likely to have experienced a new physical assault compared to their caucasian counterparts .
other studies have confirmed the finding that african americans are at the greatest risk of violence . in his assessment of lifetime rates of violence among men and women ,
kilpatrick et al . found 28% of african americans reported that they had been assault victims , compared with 19% of caucasians .
low income is also reported as a predictive factor for assault . a study of income and risk of assault by kessler et al .
, found persons of both sexes with annual household incomes below $ 15,000 are one and a half times more likely to be physically assaulted as persons with annual household incomes above $ 15,000 .
the inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and susceptibility to assault was confirmed again in a study in milwaukee , wisconsin study adolescent assault victims which found subjects with lower median household incomes experienced higher rates of interpersonal violence .
the costs of nonfatal physical assault are significant and entail more than simply the physical injury sustained by the victim .
victims of violent assault also experience psychological injury , lost productivity from missed work and school days , and loss of quality of life due to pain and suffering .
lifetime costs for intentional injury for patients twelve and older were estimated at $ 187 billion during the period from 1987 - 1990 , with $ 96 billion dollars attributed to injury from assault .
the estimate $ 96 billion dollar cost associated with injury from assault included approximately $ 8 billion dollars for medical costs , $ 53 billion for mental health care costs and $ 35 billion for lost quality of life .
this breaks down to a per physical injury cost for assault victims of $ 22,000 .
although racial and socioeconomic disparities and the costs of these disparities to assault victims is well documented , the predictive factors that lead to these disparities in female assault victims remains an open area of research .
the interplay between the identified predictors of assault and their combined contribution to violent victimization in women is better elucidated .
existing literature fails to show the influence that one predictor of assault has on the co - existence of other predictors of assault .
this interplay suggests that even though individual risk factors may increase the likelihood of assault , the combination of multiple risk factors , creates a susceptible patient population that is significantly more likely to experience assault .
the identification of this interaction between two different risk factors could be useful to select a population more susceptible to the risk for assault and trauma than any other individual risk factor alone would be able to predict . selecting for a susceptible population would allow public health efforts to be focused appropriately on the highest risk population .
additionally , existing literature largely draws conclusions from all emergency room visits and fails to specifically analyze "" severe assaults , "" or assaults serious enough in nature to necessitate trauma activation .
the purpose of this study is to determine predictors of assault and predictors of high - risk behaviors in women who sustain injuries significant enough to require state of illinois trauma activation . identifying the predictive factors that make women a susceptible population to assault requiring trauma activation will help inform injury prevention efforts and ideally lead to a reduction in violent victimization among women .
to identify both predictors of severe assault and the high - risk behaviors of severely assaulted women , a retrospective analysis of all female trauma patients was performed using the illinois department of public health trauma registry .
the registry is a state - wide , mandatory reporting system that contains de - identified information for all trauma patients from all trauma centers in illinois .
permission to use the database was obtained from the illinois department of public health and this study was approved by the university institutional review board . for the period 1999 - 2003 , all female trauma patients aged 15 - 50 were identified . the following e - codes for assault were used to identify the female victims : 960 ( 0.0 - 0.1 ) , 961 , 962 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) , 963 - 964 , 965 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) , 966 , 967 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) , 968 ( 0.0 - 0.9 ) and victims of gunshot and stabbing wounds were included in this group . the remaining women ( n = 23,841 ) who had other , non - assault mechanisms of injury served as the control group .
demographic data was collected on both the study and control groups to include age , race , pregnancy status , alcohol and drug use , insurance status , residence in a rural area [ table 1 ] .
drug use was based on the presence of one or more of the following seven substances : amphetamine , barbiturates , benzodiazepines , cocaine , marijuana , opiates , and phencyclidine .
patients were considered uninsured if they had medicaid or were listed as having no insurance .
medicaid patients were considered uninsured because many of these patients entered the hospital without insurance and were enrolled in medicaid only during their hospital stay .
chicago , springfield , and east saint louis are considered urban ; all other areas fall under the rural category . demographic characteristics and predictors of assault in female trauma victims by mechanism of injury data
a logistic regression model was used to compare the two groups of female victims ( those who were assaulted against those who had other mechanisms of injury ) on variables including age , race , pregnancy status , alcohol and drug use , rural residence and lack of insurance , in order to identify factors predictive of assault and high - risk behaviors .
once factors predictive of assault were identified , a separate analysis was conducted to study interaction affects among these identified risk factors .
this additional analysis examined the combined effect of the identified predictors of assault on end outcome- all possible variations of combined risk factors were studied .
in a retrospective review of all trauma patients from all trauma centers in the state of illinois for the time period 1999 - 2003 , 26,602 female victims were identified . of these 26,602 female victims , 2,761 ( 10.4% )
reported assault as their mechanism of injury , and the remaining 23,841 women had other listed mechanisms of injury . in comparing the two groups ,
the age distribution in the assaulted women group was younger than in the other mechanism of injury group .
about 53.4% of the assaulted women group was in the ages 15 - 30 , while in the other mechanism of injury group , only 48.1% fell in this age range . in regards to race
, 75.6% of assaults were against non - white women , in contrast to the female victims of non - assaultive traumas , of whom only 35.6% were non - white .
this disparity was largely due to the significant percentage ( 64.3% ) of assaulted women who were of african american descent .
other races did not factor significantly in the racial disparity between the assaulted and other mechanism of injury groups , largely due to small total numbers in the study population . in addition to being non - white , women who were assaulted were also more likely to use alcohol ( 54.7% versus 39.6% ) and drugs ( 25.0% versus 16.2% , p
< 0.001 ) than women in the other mechanisms of injury group [ table 1 ] .
after comparing demographic differences between female trauma victims who were assaulted and female trauma victims who reported other mechanisms of injury , attention turned to identifying specific predictors of assault among the female assault victims .
on multivariate regression analysis , three variables were noted to be independent predictors of assault in the female victims including african american race ( or 3.88 , p < 0.001 ) , lack of insurance ( or 1.79 , p < 0.001 ) , and drug use ( or 1.32 , p < 0.001 ) [ table 2 ] .
age under 30 also predicted assault ( or = 1.17 , p < 0.001 ) .
neither pregnancy nor rural residence appeared to play a role in female victims likelihood of being assaulted .
predictors of assault in women in this data set , female victims with one identified predictor of assault often exhibited other predictive factors for assault .
multivariate analysis to predict the likelihood of certain risk factors among female assault victims was undertaken . in table 3
the data shows assaulted women who use alcohol are also significantly more likely to be uninsured ( or 3.5 , p < 0.001 ) and also more likely to use drugs ( or = 1.7 , p < 0.001 ) .
predictors of alcohol use in female assault victims these findings were confirmed again when predictors of drug use and uninsured status were analyzed individually .
female assault victims who used drugs were also more likely to be uninsured ( or = 1.8 , p < 0.001 ) and to use alcohol ( or = 1.7 , p < 0.001 ) .
african - american race also appeared to be more prevalent among female assault victims who used drugs ( or = 1.5 , p = 0.009 ) .
in contrast , neither latina race nor age appeared statistically significant predictors of drug use in female assault victims [ table 4 ] .
predictors of drug use in female assault victims predictors of uninsured status in female assault victims included african american race ( or 4.6 , p < 0.001 ) , alcohol use ( or 3.3 , p < 0.001 ) and drug use ( or 1.7 , p < 0.001 ) .
additionally , latina race was also a statistically significant predictor of being uninsured for female trauma patients who reported assault as their mechanism of injury [ table 5 ] . predictors of uninsured status in female assault victims clearly , female assault victims often exhibit more than one high - risk behavior or risk factor for assault .
these risk factors may not just exist in tandem but may also interact to exert a shared and therefore increased influence on the overall susceptibility of female victims to assault . the combined influence , or interaction
affects , of these risk factors on violent victimization was tested in a regression analysis [ table 6 ] .
the regression model showed that drug use and being uninsured had a combined effect of predicting assault ( or 1.67 , p < 0.02 ) .
characteristics of female assault victims and predictors of physical assault in female trauma patients were examined in this study .
the study showed women of african - american race , women without insurance , and women who used alcohol and/or drugs are disproportionately represented among assault victims .
a significant finding of this study was that female assault victims with one predictor of assault were more likely to have multiple predictors of assault and when drug use is combined with lack of insurance the likelihood of being assaulted increases . while there are known disparities in trauma , this paper highlights the interaction between these risk factors , which has not previously been studied in this patient population .
lack of insurance and drug abuse are more frequent among people with low socioeconomic status , however , having both of these factors increase the risk more that each individual factor would predict . therefore
, this susceptible population bears more of the risk for assault and trauma than any individual risk factor would predict .
this underscores the observation that there are racial and socioeconomic disparities with respect to violent victimization , and makes an argument for specific interventions to this high risk population .
this study demonstrates that predictors of assault in women frequently coexist and both independently and in combination may increase risk .
one possibility is that one of the predictors of assault identified in this study , for example , lack of insurance , is the unifying link that increases the likelihood of a victim exhibiting all other predictors of assault .
another possibility is that an unnamed risk factor such as poverty or education level is the link that explains the co - existence of all of these high - risk taking behaviors in one setting .
there is also the possibility that the temporal order between victimization and the identified predictors of assault is inverse to what is interpreted in this paper .
that is , instead of drug use and lack of insurance being factors predicting the likelihood of women to experience assault , females may be more likely to use drugs and alcohol and not have insurance precisely because they have been assaulted .
the significance of the co - existence of multiple predictors of assaults in female victims is relevant both to the understanding of what leads to gender - based violent victimization and how healthcare providers and society can most effectively intervene .
however , this study is not without limitations , including defining a rural / urban dichotomy on the basis of population , without considering boundaries or suburbs , and possible lack of generalizability as this study is restricted to urban patients from a single state in the u.s .
it also would have been beneficial to have data on a wider range of predictors of assault including socioeconomic status , education level , u.s .
despite its limitations , this is a powerful study that demonstrates the interdependence of risk factors for assault in a population - based sample of women in a large midwestern state .
this study helps us gain an understanding of how predictors of assault in female victims interact and lead to an increase susceptibility to violent victimization .
although there is no acceptable justification for violence against women , understanding the factors that predict assault in women can serve as a way to increase awareness of the victimization of women and to help better direct intervention and prevention efforts , especially in areas such as multimodality drug or treatment programs or comprehensive domestic violence shelters offering drug and alcohol services .
future research should also be directed at identifying protective factors against female violent victimization , which remains a yet unexplored area of study ."	" background : assault is a common mechanism of injury among female trauma victims . 
 this paper identifies risk factors for assault in female victims and explores the interplay between identified predictors of assault and their combined contribution to female violent victimization.materials and methods : a retrospective analysis of all female trauma patients was performed using the illinois department of public health trauma registry from 1999 - 2003 . 
 patients with assault listed as their mechanism of injury were compared to patients with other mechanisms of injury . 
 bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed using stata statistical software to identify independent risk factors for assault . 
 finally , interaction affects were studied among these identified risk factors.results:female victims of assault were more likely to be african american ( or 1.32 , p < 0.001 ) , lack insurance ( or 1.79 , p < 0.001 ) , and to have tested positive for drugs ( or 1.32 , p < 0.001 ) than women with other mechanisms of injury . 
 in addition to the independent effects of these variables , patient drug use and lack of insurance demonstrated interaction effects ( or 1.67 , p = 0.02).conclusion : in this study , women of color , the uninsured , and those using drugs were disproportionately represented among assault victims , highlighting further evidence of trauma disparities . 
 most significantly , this study demonstrates that predictors of assault in women frequently coexist and both independently and in combination may increase the risk for female violent victimization . "	"INTRODUCTION
MATERIALS AND METHODS
RESULTS
DISCUSSION
CONCLUSION"
73	"right ventricular ( rv ) pacing can lead to progressive left ventricular ( lv ) systolic dysfunction and heart failure due to electrical and mechanical dyssynchrony .
the deleterious effect of rv pacing on lv systolic function has been termed pacing - induced cardiomyopathy ( picm ) .
upgrading to biventricular pacing ( bivp ) reverses lv remodeling in patients with picm as it does in primary bivp recipients . on the other hand , in patients requiring cardiac resynchronization therapy ( crt ) , permanent his - bundle pacing ( hbp )
an 87-year - old woman with chronic heart failure and chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) was admitted to our hospital due to worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema .
she had undergone permanent pacemaker implantation 6 years before because of 2:1 atrioventricular ( av ) block with a narrow qrs complex ( fig .
her medications included torasemide 4  mg , carvedilol 5  mg , and valsartan 40  mg .
a 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ecg ) showed atrial sensed ventricular pacing with a qrs duration of 140  ms ( fig .
pacemaker interrogation revealed that her native cardiac rhythm remained 2:1 av block with a narrow qrs , and ventricular pacing was greater than 99% .
chest x - ray revealed an enlarged cardiothoracic ratio ( ctr ) of 60% and bilateral pleural effusions ( fig .
coronary angiography and echocardiography performed before pacemaker implantation had revealed normal coronary arteries and a lvef of 65% , respectively .
further medical treatment with carperitide and intravenous furosemide did not improve the pleural effusions or lvef .
because the patients native cardiac rhythm remained 2:1 av block with a narrow qrs , we thought hbp would be better than bivp , and thus we attempted permanent hbp as the first - line treatment . although the his bundle ( hb ) electrogram could not be clearly identified , narrow qrs complexes suggesting nonselective hbp ( his capture fused with local ventricular septal capture ) were easily obtained using a selectsecure 3830 screw - in lead inserted through a selectsite c304 deflectable catheter ( medtronic , minneapolis , mn , usa ) by pace - mapping the av septum .
the pacing thresholds of the hb and the adjacent septal myocardium were 1.0  v/0.4  ms and 0.75  v/0.4  ms , respectively .
the hb pacing lead was connected to the lv port of a biventricular ( biv ) pacemaker ( viva crt - p , medtronic ) .
we chose this device because it has no sensing ability in the lv lead ( in this case , the hb lead ) and thus does not cause double counts with a delay in the hv interval and safety pacing in rv pacing .
this delay was set to provide back - up rv pacing in case the hb pacing lead failed to capture the right ventricle .
after the 1-week follow - up , the pacing threshold of the hb had improved slightly to 0.75  v/0.4  ms , while that of the adjacent septal myocardium was 1.0  v/0.4  ms .
echocardiography at 1 month after the upgrade demonstrated improvement in the patients lvef from 33% to 45% , and the brain natriuretic peptide level decreased from 1208  pg / ml to 97  pg / ml . at the
chest x - ray revealed improvement of the ctr to 45% without pleural effusion ( fig .
the pacing threshold of the hb remained stable at 0.75  v/0.4  ms and that of the adjacent septal myocardium was 1.0  v/0.4  ms .
upgrading to bivp has been reported as an effective therapy for picm ; however , about 3040% of patients do not respond to this treatment .
in addition , performing bivp can be challenging with a long procedural time and might even be impossible due to the coronary sinus anatomy .
rehwinkel et al . demonstrated that upgrading to hbp could be an effective alternative to bivp for picm with preserved his - purkinje conduction . because our patients native rhythm remained 2:1 av block with a narrow qrs
, we attempted hbp as the first - line treatment based on the assumption that his - purkinje conduction might be preserved .
another benefit of hbp in this patient with ckd is that the use of iodinated contrast media could be avoided .
hbp using a deflectable lead delivery system was easily achieved with a fluoroscopic time of 8 minutes .
lustgarten et al . reported that hb pacing lead placement with this system was no more difficult and took less time to implant than placement of a lv lead .
our patient is thought to be a super - responder to crt by hbp although the form of hbp was nonselective
. however , there seems to be no significant clinical difference between selective hbp ( his - only capture ) and nonselective hbp because both forms do not alter physiological impulse conduction and possibly maintain rapid and synchronous lv activation .
indeed , catanzariti et al . reported that no difference was observed between the two forms of hbp at acute measures of dyssynchrony .
most patients with picm having a native narrow qrs have preserved his - purkinje conduction , and therefore upgrading to hbp would be expected to restore physiological synchronous lv activation .
recently , vijayaraman et al . demonstrated that his - purkinje conduction could be normalized by permanent hbp in 76% of patients with infranodal av block and a wide qrs complex , indicating intra - his block .
this finding suggests that many patients with picm having a native wide qrs might have preserved distal his - purkinje conduction , and permanent hbp at the distal hb ( distal to the site of the block / delay ) could restore physiological synchronous lv activation .
the hb pacing threshold remained excellent in our patient at the 6-month follow - up ; however , long - term follow - up is necessary .
theoretically , hbp is a more physiological treatment than bivp in patients with picm having preserved his - purkinje conduction .
further studies are needed to evaluate the long - term safety and efficacy of permanent hbp in patients with picm . in conclusion
this case shows that permanent hbp can be an effective alternative to bivp with significant improvements in heart failure symptoms and lvef ."	" right ventricular ( rv ) pacing has been reported to result in ventricular dyssynchrony , heart failure , and increased mortality . 
 pacing associated deterioration of left ventricular ( lv ) systolic function has been termed pacing - induced cardiomyopathy ( picm ) . while upgrading to biventricular pacing ( bivp ) is an effective therapy for picm , permanent his - bundle pacing ( hbp ) can be a physiological alternative to bivp . 
 we present a patient with picm who responded dramatically to permanent hbp . "	"Introduction

Conflict of interest"
76	"hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) is one of the main causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma , where approximately 350,000 deaths occur each year due to hcv - related liver diseases .
the latest estimation indicates that more than 185 million people around the world ( 2.8% of the world population ) have been infected with hcv . in china , approximately 2.2% of the population on average
were infected with hcv ( most of which were genotype 1b ) , with a distribution range from 2.1% in fujian province to 9.6% in henan province . to inhibit the global prevalence of hcv infection , various strategies with regard to therapeutic medication
the traditional standard of care contains pegylated interferon plus ribavirin ( rbv ) , which could help genotype 1b patients to achieve sustained virological response ( svr ) rates of 45% , further up to 6575% for genotype 2/3 patients .
although patients chronically infected with hepatitis c virus ( chc ) in asia carries more beneficial il28b genotypes , nearly 20% of them could not achieve svr . in this
regard , more than 30 newly developed direct - acting antivirals ( daas ) have readily been approved in the europe , north american , and japan or are currently being in phase 2/3 clinical trials .
daas mainly encompass ns3/4a protease inhibitors ( pis , such as telaprevir , boceprevir , simeprevir , mk-8742 , asunaprevir , etc . ) , ns5a inhibitors ( such as daclatasvir , ledipasvir [ ldv ] , mk-5172 , etc . ) , and ns5b polymerase inhibitors ( such as sofosbuvir [ sof ] , dasabuvir , etc . ) .
in general , they are effective toward pan - genotypic hcv by helping patients to achieve high svr rates up to 100% , especially genotype 1b chc patients
. the high replication rate of hcv , along with the low fidelity and poor proof - reading of its polymerase , generates a highly variable virus population denoted as  quasispecies .
 the creation of variants encoding amino acid substitutions may result in reduced susceptibility to antiviral agents .
compared with hiv , the rate of emergence of resistant variants is much higher for hcv .
it is estimated that the error rate of the hcv polymerase is 10-fold higher than that of hiv , and the rate of production of rna virus is 100-fold higher than that of hiv .
data from clinical trials have revealed that baseline resistance - associated variants ( ravs ) were correlated with treatment outcomes of daas .
for example , patients presented pis ravs , such as q80k , d168e / v , ns5a ravs l31m / v , y93h , and ns5b polymerase inhibitors ravs l159f , c316n , v321a achieved svr rates much lower than those who did not .
ravs could exist even as minor variants at baseline , which would rapidly become the main strain under selective pressure , subsequently leading to a treatment - failure .
however , compared with population sequencing , the expense for ultra - deep sequencing was relatively high .
since none of the daas has been approved in china , there have been seldom reports by far on baseline daas ravs in our country . in turn
, it remains unclear if it is necessary to detect baseline daas ravs before daas treatment . in this study , we perform both population sequencing and deep sequencing to detect baseline daas ravs in genotype 1b chc patients in china .
serum samples were derived from 160 treatment - nave patients chronically infected with genotype 1b hcv .
population sequencing was carried out in 160 patients to figure out the prevalence of ravs in gt1b treatment - nave chc patients .
ultra - deep sequencing was carried out in 23 patients to find out minor variants with low mutation frequencies .
the study was conducted in accordance with the international society for pharmacoepidemiology guidelines for good epidemiology practices and applicable regulatory requirements .

all of the ravs detected by ultra - deep sequencing could be detected by population sequencing .
about 92.5% ( 148/160 ) of the patients were successfully amplified with the ns5a fragments , 14.9% ( 22/148 ) of whom presented at least one ns5a protein inhibitors ravs .
about 6.1% ( 9/148 ) of the patients presented q30r variant , 8.8% ( 13/148 ) of the patients presented q54h variant , 10.1% ( 14/148 ) of the patients presented y93h variant .
only synonymous substitutions were detected at amino acid sites 23 , 28 , and 32 .
nucleoside substitutions from a to g at 6347 site were detected in 42.6% ( 63/148 ) patients , which could only cause synonymous substitutions at amino acid site 31 [ table 3 ] . according to the results of ultra - deep sequencing , the average mutation frequencies were 61.0% for q30r , 13.5% for q54h , 95.7% for q62h , 14% for y93h .
interestingly , the daclatasvir , ldv , and mk-8742 ravs l31 m have not been detected by population sequencing in any one of the 148 patients but have been detected by ultra - deep sequencing in 3 patients , with average mutation frequencies of 4.7% .
the fragments of ns5b were successfully amplified in 85.6% ( 137/160 ) patients . nearly , all patients presented at least one rav to polymerase inhibitors at baseline , except for one .
when considering ravs of nucleoside inhibitors , 94.2% ( 129/137 ) of the patients were detected harboring the c316n variant . when il28b genotype was regarded , the prevalence of c316n variant between patients who carried cc and non - cc genotype was identical .
there were also no significant differences between the patients with and without c316n variant for clinical characteristics , except for the hemoglobin levels ( p = 0.004 ) .
, l159f variant , which was always detected with c316n variant simultaneously , has not been detected in any of patients in our study . at the codon position 282 of ns5b ,

, regarding the cross - resistance between these four categories , we have worked out the possible overlap of ravs of different sorts of nonnucleoside inhibitors .
most of the patients presented ravs belonging to certain one category , for instance , the most epidemic rav c316n pertained to palm ii .
as results by ultra - deep sequencing , the average mutation frequencies were 41.7% for c316n , 24.8% for a338v , 26.5% for a442 t , and 31.4% for s556 g .
interestingly , l419 m variant , which was reported to be resistant to vch-759 and vch-916 , had not been detected by population sequencing and were detected in two patients as minor variants ( with average mutation frequencies of 1.6% ) .
in total , 160 treatment - nave patients chc genotype 1b were enrolled in this study .
fifty - two percent of patients were male , and the median age at testing was 46.5 ( range , 2765 ) years [ table 2 ] .
baseline characteristics of the study population bmi : body mass index ; alt : alanine aminotransferase ; ast : aspartate aminotransferase ; plt : platelet ; hcv : hepatitis c virus .
one hundred and forty - five patients ( 90.6% ) were successfully amplified with the ns3 fragments , 71% ( 103/145 ) of whom presented at least one pis ravs .
about 56.6% ( 82/145 ) of the patients presented s122 g variant , 33.1% ( 48/145 ) of the patients presented v132i variant , 13.1% ( 19/145 ) of the patients presented v170i variant , and 5.5% ( 8/145 ) of the patients presented t54s variant [ table 3 ] .
nucleoside changes at codon position 36 , 55 , and 80 were detected but could cause only synonymous substitutions .
number of patients harboring ns3/4a pis and ns5a protein inhibitors ravs daas : direct - acting antivirals ; ravs : resistance - associated variants ; pi : protease inhibitor . as results by ultra - deep sequencing ,
the average mutation frequencies were 23.6% for s122 g variants , 75.4% for v132i and 33.8% for v170i .
all of the ravs detected by ultra - deep sequencing could be detected by population sequencing .
about 92.5% ( 148/160 ) of the patients were successfully amplified with the ns5a fragments , 14.9% ( 22/148 ) of whom presented at least one ns5a protein inhibitors ravs .
about 6.1% ( 9/148 ) of the patients presented q30r variant , 8.8% ( 13/148 ) of the patients presented q54h variant , 10.1% ( 14/148 ) of the patients presented y93h variant .
only 3 patients presented p58s variant , and only 5 patients presented q62h variant . only synonymous substitutions were detected at amino acid sites 23 , 28 , and 32 .
nucleoside substitutions from a to g at 6347 site were detected in 42.6% ( 63/148 ) patients , which could only cause synonymous substitutions at amino acid site 31 [ table 3 ] . according to the results of ultra - deep sequencing , the average mutation frequencies were 61.0% for q30r , 13.5% for q54h , 95.7% for q62h , 14% for y93h .
interestingly , the daclatasvir , ldv , and mk-8742 ravs l31 m have not been detected by population sequencing in any one of the 148 patients but have been detected by ultra - deep sequencing in 3 patients , with average mutation frequencies of 4.7% .
the fragments of ns5b were successfully amplified in 85.6% ( 137/160 ) patients . nearly , all patients presented at least one rav to polymerase inhibitors at baseline , except for one .
when considering ravs of nucleoside inhibitors , 94.2% ( 129/137 ) of the patients were detected harboring the c316n variant . when il28b genotype was regarded , the prevalence of c316n variant between patients who carried cc and non - cc genotype was identical .
there were also no significant differences between the patients with and without c316n variant for clinical characteristics , except for the hemoglobin levels ( p = 0.004 ) .
, l159f variant , which was always detected with c316n variant simultaneously , has not been detected in any of patients in our study . at the codon position 282 of ns5b ,
the primary sof resistant associated variant , only synonymous variant ( agc<->agt ) was detected .
other important ravs to ns5b polymerase inhibitors , such as l320f , v321a , and v499a , were detected in our study .
in addition , only three patients presented s142 at baseline , whereas none of the patients exhibited the resistant type n142 t [ tables 4 and 5 ] .
number of patients harboring ns5b polymerase inhibitors ravs ( n = 137 ) ravs : resistance - associated variants .
baseline characteristics of the patients with and without c316n variant bmi : body mass index ; alt : alanine aminotransferase ; ast : aspartate aminotransferase ; plt : platelet ; peg - ifn : pegylated interferon ; rbv : ribavirin ; svr : sustained virological response ; hcv : hepatitis c virus .
it is worth - mentioning that some ravs of nonnucleoside inhibitors were also detected in our study , such as v494a / t / l , v499a ( thumb i ) ; m423i / t , m424v , m426 t
( thumb ii ) ; h95q , m414i / l , s556g / n ( palm i ) ; s365a / l / s / t ( palm ii ) , etc . , regarding the cross - resistance between these four categories , we have worked out the possible overlap of ravs of different sorts of nonnucleoside inhibitors .
most of the patients presented ravs belonging to certain one category , for instance , the most epidemic rav c316n pertained to palm ii .
as results by ultra - deep sequencing , the average mutation frequencies were 41.7% for c316n , 24.8% for a338v , 26.5% for a442 t , and 31.4% for s556 g .
interestingly , l419 m variant , which was reported to be resistant to vch-759 and vch-916 , had not been detected by population sequencing and were detected in two patients as minor variants ( with average mutation frequencies of 1.6% ) .
in our study , as many as 71% of genotype 1b treatment - nave patients presented at least one ns3/4a pis rav .
the most prevalent variant was s122 g ( 56.6% ) , which has been confirmed as one of the major ravs of simeprevir ( one of the first - generation second - wave pis ) . in concerto trial conducted in japan ,
the baseline prevalence of s122 g variant was relatively lower ( 34.9% ) than that of our findings , while the baseline prevalence of v170i variant was relatively higher ( 39.6% vs. 13.1% ) than our findings .
t54s variant detected in our study was also correlated with resistance to simeprevir , with relatively low prevalence ( 5.5% ) .
mutations associated with first - generation first - wave pis detected in this study were t54s ( telaprevir and boceprevir ) , s122 g ( telaprevir ) , and v170i ( telaprevir ) . however , these ravs only conferred low - level resistance to these two licensed daas . with respect to other reports
, none of other baseline polymorphisms correlated with treatment outcomes of pis were detected in our study .
for example , r155k and d168e / v variants were ravs of asunaprevir ( had licensed in combination with daclatasvir as interferon [ ifn]-free regimens in japan ) and mk-5172 ( one of the second generation pis ) , none of which were found .
this discrepancy might be due to the fact that virus of different quasispecies even within the same subtype has different mutations . since all of the ravs detected by ultra - deep sequencing could be detected by population sequencing
, we can conclude that population sequencing could qualified for baseline pis ravs screening in china .
as one of the most important ravs of most of the ns5a protein inhibitors , y93h variants were detected in 10.1% of patients included in our study .
l31 m variants , another mutation associated with treatment outcomes of ldv , daclatasvir , and abt-267 , were only detected by ultra - deep sequencing in three patients with low mutation frequencies .
several in vitro studies have reported that single l31 m variant could only lead to 3-fold change with ec50 of daclatasvir .
single y93h variant could lead to 24-fold change of it while combination mutations of l31 m plus y93h could lead to 7105-fold change with ec50 of daclatasvir . in addition , single y93h variant could lead to 77-fold change of ec50 of abt-267 while l31 m plus y93h could lead to 142-fold change of it .
what 's more , y93h variant could lead to extremely high - level ( 994-fold ) fold - change with ec50 of ldv .
although ns5a protein inhibitors were usually used in combination with pis ( such as asunaprevir ) , baseline polymorphisms of l31 m or y93h could make patients to experience virologic relapse more easily and achieved much lower svr rates .
data by ultra - deep sequencing revealed that most of the ns5a protein inhibitors ravs detected here were with relatively high mutation frequencies , except for l31 m variants .
nevertheless , l31 m variants occurred only in three patients with low mutation frequencies . in this way
, population sequencing might be qualified for baseline ns5a protein inhibitors ravs screening in china .
the detection of naturally occurring ravs of ns5b polymerase inhibitors at baseline has been reported in numerous studies . some of them may influence the treatment outcomes of daas - containing regimens . in the clinical trials of sof - containing regimens ,
the primary concern lies in the s282 t , an important variant associated with treatment - failure .
however , a representative study conducted by fda from the us suggested that ns5b - c316n was found to be associated with treatment failure when patients chc genotype 1b receiving sof plus rbv therapy , throughout re - systemizing all the data from sof - containing trials where ultra - deep sequencing was performed . in the clinical trial p7977 - 2025 , 16/61 posttransplantation patients failed therapy of sof plus rbv , where 6/16 patients harbored c316n at baseline , in other words , all of the six patients did not achieve svr . on the contrary , for the other 45 patients who achieved svr12 ,
eighty - two percent ( 45/55 ) of the patients who did not carry c316n pretreatment achieved svr12 .
however , 66.7% ( 4/6 ) of patients harbored l159f at the same time . in clinical trial neutrino , 4/66 of the patients harbored c316n variant at baseline , 50% of which ( 2/4 ) experienced virologic relapse after receiving treatment of sof plus rbv . in this trial ,
rav c316n is located in palm ii ( allosteric ) . despite the fact that the majority of ravs of sof reported are at the active sites ( such as s282 t and n142 t )
, position 316 was deemed as the only different residue within 8 a in the ns5b polymerase between hcv genotype 1a and 1b .
n316 in hcv gt1b polymerase structure is much larger than c316 , which might lead to the block of the active site of sof .
however , c316 has been reported to be relatively conserved in gt1a , but polymorphic in gt1b .
data from los alamos databank showed that the prevalence of c316n was much higher in asia than worldwide ( 91.6% vs. 36% ) as well as american continent ( from 0% to 18% ) . in our study , both the ultra - deep sequencing and population sequencing revealed that the prevalence of c316n variant in treatment - nave chinese gt1b chc patients was quite high , which is in good agreement with previous findings .
as part of ifn - free regimens , sof in combination with ldv with and without rbv has been one of the most important regimens nowadays . combination treatment could help patients to overcome antiviral resistance more easily .
, data showed that the patient presented ns5a - l31m - y93h joined variants as previously stated , simultaneously harbored ns5b - c316n . even in the combination regimens of sof plus ldv , baseline polymorphisms of y93h
results by ultra - deep sequencing showed that the mutation frequencies increased dramatically at the time of relapse . both rav
s282 t and n142 t were at the active site of ns5b polymerase , but none of the 137 patients exhibited the existence of these two variants .
since most of the patients presented ravs of one category , cross - resistance seems less likely to occur .
data by ultra - deep sequencing revealed that most of the ns5b polymerase inhibitors ravs detected here were with high mutation frequencies , especially for c316n variants .
nevertheless , l419 m variants occurred only in two patients with low mutation frequencies . in this way
, population sequencing might qualify for baseline ns5b polymerase inhibitors ravs screening in china . in conclusion , we have employed both the ultra - deep sequencing and population sequencing methods to detect daas ravs in genotype 1b treatment - nave patients , among which the prevalence of variants related with treatment - failure of ns3/4a pis ( s122 g ) , ns5b polymerase inhibitors ( c316n ) and ns5a inhibitors ( y93h ) were quite high , in particular , c316n . currently high prevalence and high mutation frequencies of rav c316n in china might impede the virologic response when distributing sof - containing regimens in the near future .
our findings suggest that pretreatment sequencing of hcv genome might need to be performed when patients infected with gt1b hcv receiving daas - containing regimens in china .

" background : it has been reported that several baseline polymorphisms of direct - acting antivirals ( daas ) agents resistance - associated variants ( ravs ) would affect the treatment outcomes of patients chronically infected with hepatitis c virus ( chc ) . 
 the aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of daas ravs in treatment - nave gt1b chc patients.methods:direct sequencing and ultra - deep sequencing of the hcv ns3 , ns5a , and ns5b gene were performed in baseline serum samples of treatment - nave patients infected with genotype 1b hepatitis c virus ( hcvs).results : one hundred and sixty chc patients were studied . 
 complete sequence information was obtained for 145 patients ( ns3 ) , 148 patients ( ns5a ) , and 137 patients ( ns5b ) . 
 treatment - failure associated variants of daas were detected : 56.6% ( 82/145 ) of the patients presented s122 g for simeprevir ( ns3 protease inhibitor ) ; 10.1% ( 14/148 ) of the patients presented y93h for daclatasvir and ledipasvir ( ns5a protein inhibitors ) ; 94.2% ( 129/137 ) of the patients presented c316n for sofosbuvir ( ns5b polymerase inhibitor ) . 
 nearly , all of the daas ravs detected by ultra - deep sequencing could be detected by direct sequencing.conclusions:the majority of genotype 1b chc patients in china present a virus population carrying hcv daas ravs . 
 pretreatment sequencing of hcv genome might need to be performed when patients infected with gt1b hcv receiving daas - containing regimens in china . 
 population sequencing would be quite quantified for the work . "	"I

78	"chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) , a treatable and preventable disease , is characterized by airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with chronic airway inflammatory response.1 this disease has some extra - pulmonary effects that may contribute to its severity.2 one of the systemic manifestations that affect these patients is related to cardiac autonomic modulation .
patients with copd have changes in this modulation that play an important role in the morbidity and mortality of these patients.3 these changes result in reduced heart rate variability ( hrv ) , which provides a noninvasive measure to evaluate modulation of the autonomic nervous system,4 describing the oscillations between consecutive heart beats ( rr intervals),5 and its application in clinical practice has increased considerably.6 muscle sympathetic nerve activity is higher in copd patients compared with healthy individuals.7,8 there is evidence of enhanced sympathetic nerve traffic , elevated catecholamines , and an activated renin - angiotensin system in these individuals.8,9 hrv has been investigated in several pathological conditions such as hypertension,10 myocardial infarction,11 coronary artery disease,12,13 diabetes,14 stroke,15 and obstructive sleep apnea.16 it is known that decreased hrv is considered an independent risk factor for mortality in healthy people , especially after acute myocardial infarction and is related to adrenergic hyperactivity and decreased parasympathetic activity.4,11,17 furthermore , hrv has also been used to investigate physiological changes such as those associated with the execution of exercise.6 exercise promotes important changes in the functioning of the cardiovascular system and its autonomic adjustment mechanisms.1821 in healthy subjects , performing exercise has been associated with decreased parasympathetic and increased sympathetic modulation22 and , after its performance , the cardiac sympathetic modulation remains increased and the parasympathetic reduced.23,24 in copd patients undergoing exercise , cardiac autonomic modulation has been scarcely studied , especially in the post - exercise period .
understanding these responses may have significant clinical importance in these patients.1 regarding physical exercises in copd patients , resistance exercise ( re ) has been considered an important component in pulmonary rehabilitation25 since these patients have skeletal muscle dysfunction that is associated with limited exercise tolerance , fatigue , and dyspnea26 which are considered negative prognostic factors in copd.27 therefore , considering that hrv has proven to be a clinically valuable tool for evaluation of neurological control of the heart , the scarcity of information regarding cardiac autonomic modulation in the post - exercise period , and considering that physiotherapy utilizes exercise programs as part of copd patient treatment , the aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac autonomic modulation through hrv after an acute session of re at different intensities in copd patients .
we hypothesize that the execution of an acute session of re in copd patients modifies autonomic modulation after its completion , and that these responses are dependent on the intensity of the exercise performed .
it is hoped that this study will contribute relevant information about the impact of re on the autonomic modulation of copd patients .
for the realization of this study , data from 12 copd patients were analyzed . to participate in the study the patients had to have undergone spirometry and received a medical diagnosis of the disease , as recommended by the global initiative for obstructive lung disease,1 and not have the following characteristics : smoking , home oxygen therapy use , participation in another physical training program prior to this study , reported presence of heart co - morbidities that prevented the execution of the experimental protocol , musculoskeletal disorders and alteration or addition of medication that affects the autonomic nervous system .
all procedures of this study were approved by the ethics committee of the institution ( caae : 00849812.0.0000.5402 ) and all patients signed an informed consent form . the experimental protocol comprised an initial assessment and the assessment of autonomic function against re of 60% and 90% of the one repetition maximum test ( 1rm ) , which was performed on subsequent days . the initial assessment consisted of volunteer identification , anthropometric measurements , lung function evaluation by spirometry test , and 1rm . for all visits ,
patients were instructed to : avoid consuming caffeine 24 hours before the procedures ; eat a light meal 2 hours before testing , abstain from alcoholic beverages for at least 4 hours , have a good night s sleep ( 78 hours ) , avoid strenuous physical exercise the day before the evaluations , and be dressed in comfortable and appropriate clothing for exercise performance .
lung function test was performed using a spirometer ( spirobank - mir3.6 ; mir , rome , italy ) , according to the guidelines of the american thoracic society and european respiratory society.28 normality values were related to the brazilian population.29 the 1rm test was performed before re sessions , to determine the workload to be executed . prior to this test
the correct execution of the exercise was demonstrated to the patients in order to avoid errors in its performance .
patients underwent specific warming - up before the test and for its realization an initial workload of 20% of body weight for lower , and 5% of body weight for upper limbs was set . for the determination of 1rm , subjects had three to five attempts at intervals ranging between 3 to 5 minutes ( min ) .
the test was completed when the patient reached the load that caused mechanical failure of execution , and the final load at which they managed to perform the exercise without mechanical failure was established as a maximum load .
all tests were supervised by the same evaluator.30 the movements tested to determine the 1rm and , thereafter , were : knee flexion , knee extension , shoulder flexion , shoulder abduction , and elbow flexion .
the re series was performed for 50 min on weight training equipment ( ipiranga pulley system ; hard academy , so paulo , brazil ) regulated in accordance with the proper positioning of the patient for the correct execution of the exercises .
the movements during the exercises were : knee flexion , knee extension , shoulder flexion , shoulder abduction , and elbow flexion .
three series of ten repetitions of each exercise , with intervals of 1 min of rest between each series , at both intensities of 60% and 90% of 1rm were performed .
the implementation of protocols of 60% and 90% was performed randomly and with an interval of 48 hours . to control , blood pressure , heart rate ( hr ) , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , and degree of dyspnea were noted before and after exercise . for the hrv analysis ,
patients hr was recorded beat - by - beat using a polar s810i hr monitor ( polar electro , kempele , finland ) , a previously validated device for capturing the beat - to - beat hr and its utilization for hrv analysis.31,32 after the explanation of the data collection procedures , an elastic catchment strap was placed on the chest of the volunteer , at the height of the xiphoid process , and the hr receiver was attached to their wrist .
initially , an hr reading for each patient was taken in the sitting position for 20 min and another after realization of the re .
the hrv assessment was performed on 2 separate days , one day at 60% and another at 90% of 1rm intensity for each exercise . for hrv indexes analysis ,
256 consecutive rr intervals were selected for each time the hrv assessed , 5 minutes more stable from tracings , which were subjected to digital filtering by polar precision performance sw software ( version 4.01.029 ) supplemented by manual filtering to eliminate ectopic premature beats and artifacts , and only series with more than 95% sinus beats were included in the study.21,22,33 kubios software version 2.0 ( mathworks , natick , ma , usa)34 was used to calculate hrv indexes in the time and frequency domains .
the calculated indexes in the time domain were the following : standard deviation of normal to normal rr intervals ( sdnn [ ms ] ) and root mean square of differences between adjacent normal rr intervals in a time interval ( rmssd [ ms]).22,35 for hrv analysis in the frequency domain , we used the spectral components of low frequency ( lf : 0.04 to 0.15 hz ) and high frequency ( hf : 0.15 to 0.4 hz ) frequency , in normalized units and milliseconds , in addition to the lf / hf ratio.4,22,35 the hrv indexes were measured at the following times : baseline / rest , immediately after sessions , and at 5 , 10 , and 15 min after . for the population profile data analysis , a descriptive statistical method was used and the results were presented with mean , standard deviations , and minimum and maximum values .
comparisons of hrv indices among protocols ( 60% and 90% of 1rm ) and moments ( baseline , immediately after , 5 , 10 , and 15 min after ) were made by the technique of two - way analysis of variance for repeated measures model .
the repeated measurement data were checked for violations of sphericity using mauchly s test and the greenhouse - geisser correction was used when sphericity was violated . for moments analysis (
basal versus immediately after , 5 , 10 , and 15 min after ) bonferroni post - test for parametric distribution or dunnet s post - test for nonparametric distribution was used .
statistical significance was set at 5% for all analyses and calculations were performed using the software spss version 13.0 ( spss inc . ,

the patients anthropometric characteristics , their spirometric values , and their basal blood pressure values are described in table 1 .
in addition , 64% used angiotensin receptor antagonists , 9% diuretics , 27% hypolipidemics , 9% anti - inflammatories , and 9% anti - allergic agents .
table 2 presents the hr and hrv indexes in the time domain at all evaluated moments .
no significant differences in hr and rmssd and sdnn between the protocols were observed at all analyzed time points ( p>0.05 ) .
no differences were found in hr and rmssd index when comparing all times after the exercise session compared to baseline values both at 60% and 90% of 1rm .
it was noted that sdnn ( ms ) was significantly higher in every moment after re compared to baseline for both 60% and 90% of 1rm .
no significant differences in rates between the protocols were observed at all analyzed time points ( p>0.05 ) . regarding the comparison between moments , it was observed that the lf ( ms ) index was higher at all times of recovery when compared to rest in both 60% and 90% of 1rm protocols .
the same was observed for the hf index ( ms ) also in both protocols .
the results obtained in this study demonstrated that acute sessions of re influenced hrv indexes regarding the analyzed moment , since the differences were observed in the recovery period compared to baseline . furthermore , there was no difference between protocols showing that , regardless of the intensity of the performed exercise , the recovery of autonomic modulation in these patients is similar .
several studies have described the behavior of hrv after aerobic exercise,3639 but few show the response of autonomic function after re . in those that evaluated hrv after re , the authors found an increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity during the post - exercise recovery period.23,24,40 in addition , there are no studies that evaluate autonomic modulation during recovery in patients with copd undergoing res and the influence of exercise intensity in this response . the sdnn index , which reflects the overall variability , displayed a significant increase in moments of recovery compared to baseline . during the recovery from exercise period ,
the initial return of hr to baseline occurs primarily due to parasympathetic reactivation.41,42 with the cessation of exercise , there is a loss of central command , and the baroreflex activation and other mechanisms contribute to the increase in parasympathetic activity.42,43 this parasympathetic reactivation promotes an increase in rr intervals variation , which may be associated with sdnn index increase .
increased sympathetic activity after re has been described in the literature.44 a study by lima et al , that evaluated the acute effects of strength exercise on hrv in young people , showed that when they performed the session with 70% of 1rm there was an increase in the lf index in the recovery period compared to pre - intervention.24 these findings corroborate the present study , since the lf ( ms ) index remained raised after re at both 60% and 90% of 1rm intensities . regarding the parasympathetic component in the recovery period of re , heffernan et
al showed that 25 min after the cessation of exercise , the hr index remained reduced in healthy subjects.23 the same happened in the oliveira et al study , in which hrv was assessed immediately after the cessation of exercise in healthy men who underwent 12 months of re.44 the data from this study do not confirm these findings since the hf ( ms ) index remained raised throughout the period of recovery from exercise at both 60% and 90% of 1rm in copd patients .
a study by javorka et al,42 which evaluated hrv in healthy men after the step test , which assesses functional capacity , showed a marked reduction in the hf index during exercise and an increase during recovery , indicating parasympathetic reactivation after exercise .
the authors also found a gradual increase in the lf index during recovery and suggest that the lf index is directly influenced by changes in parasympathetic activity , through changes in vagal activity that cause fluctuations in the lf band , or indirectly , by changes in baroreflex sensitivity .
using hrv , gonzalez - camarena et al45 demonstrated that unlike the parasympathetic withdrawal seen during dynamic exercise , there may be an increase in vagal modulation during static exercise ( resistance ) without any change in lf / hf .
thus it is possible that modulation in the neuronal sinoatrial node after re may also be different.23 the lf / hf ratio has been shown to increase from 20 to 30 min after exercise and may remain elevated for up to 60 min post - exercise,23,45,46 suggesting a state of sympathetic predominance.47,48 in the present study , although there was no statistical difference in lf / hf ratio between the periods evaluated , we observed an increase in this index both at 60% and 90% of 1rm after re compared to baseline .
the results also showed that regardless of the intensity of the exercises performed , autonomic modulation recovery is similar , indicating that the autonomic response after re at 60% of 1rm is the same as at 90% of 1rm in these patients . using diastolic blood pressure , gurjo et al49 showed that in normotensive women different intensities of re did not influence this parameter .
copd patients have autonomic dysfunction that promotes reduced hrv compared with healthy subjects.7,50,51 this autonomic dysfunction may , at least in part , explain the absence of differences in the autonomic modulation recovery after re performed with intensity equivalent to 60% and 90% of 1rm .
this study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration . the absence of a healthy control group should be mentioned , which could have helped determine whether the responses obtained from copd patients suffer any influence from the autonomic dysfunction presented by these patients .
another limitation is related to the impossibility of hrv analysis during the performance of the re series , which could provide important information for understanding the changes in autonomic modulation during the recovery period . during the performance of the re series , rest intervals of 1 min between each repetition
additionally , while capturing hr , the patients respiratory rate was not controlled , which may have influenced the hf index . considering the importance of the theme presented ,
other studies are being conducted to evaluate the acute responses to resistance and aerobic exercise after physical training programs .
furthermore , research into the impact of different physical training protocols on autonomic modulation and clinical , biochemical , and functional variables in these individuals is being conducted .
studies of this nature can enrich knowledge in the area of exercise physiology in patients with copd . given the importance of understanding the autonomic behavior after re in copd patients , who suffer from autonomic dysfunction , which is considered a risk factor associated with mortality , this study represents a useful clinical tool for professionals in the area since the results indicate that hrv indexes , a noninvasive and inexpensive measurement , can aid both in evaluating the clinical manifestations of the disease and monitoring therapeutic procedures performed with these patients .
furthermore , there is no evidence of the impact of post - exercise autonomic modulation on mortality in copd and others diseases .
from the results obtained from this study , it is concluded that acute sessions of re impact on autonomic modulation in copd patients by promoting differences in the recovery period compared to baseline ."	" purposephysical exercises are employed as part of the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( copd ) ; however information regarding cardiac autonomic modulation after an acute session of resistance exercise ( re ) is unknown . 
 the aim of this study was to evaluate the cardiac autonomic modulation , via heart rate variability after an acute session of re applied at different intensities in copd patients.patients and methodstwelve copd patients underwent an acute session of re with an intensity of 60% and another of 90% of the one repetition maximum test . for analysis of autonomic modulation , heart rate was recorded beat - by - beat for 20 minutes at rest and after the training session . 
 heart rate variability indexes were obtained in the time and frequency domains for the assessment of autonomic modulation.resultsregardless of exercise intensity , re acute sessions influenced the autonomic modulation when the recovery period was compared with the baseline . an increase in standard deviation of normal to normal rr intervals 
 was observed throughout recovery time after the re , as compared to baseline in both protocols : 60% and 90% of the one repetition maximum test . 
 the spectral component of low frequency index ( ms ) was higher throughout recovery when compared to baseline in both protocols . 
 the same was also observed in the spectral component of high frequency index ( ms ) for the protocols of 60% and 90%.conclusionre sessions impact on the autonomic modulation of copd patients by promoting differences in the recovery period compared to baseline , regardless of the intensity of the exercise performed .

81	"previous reports have identified noninfectious uveitis as a potential sequela following both intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections .
we present two unique cases of acute anterior uveitis following intravitreal bevacizumab that did not occur with subsequent ranibizumab injections .
these cases may reflect differences in the etiology of anterior uveitis following intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab . given these differences , it may be reasonable to offer ranibizumab to patients who have experienced presumed bevacizumab - induced anterior uveitis .
studies monitoring the safety of intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections have identified noninfectious acute anterior uveitis as a sequela of both drugs.1,2 although a large retrospective case series failed to detect a significant difference in the incidence of anterior uveitis after either bevacizumab or ranibizumab,3 randomized prospective trials evaluating this complication are lacking.4 we present two cases of acute anterior uveitis following intravitreal bevacizumab that did not recur with subsequent ranibizumab therapy .
uniquely , the first case describes the risk of continued intravitreal bevacizumab following presumed bevacizumab - related acute anterior uveitis , and the second presents a case of unilateral acute anterior uveitis in a patient who had received long - term bilateral intravitreal bevacizumab injections .
a 75-year - old woman with a history of hypothyroidism received two doses of bevacizumab 8 weeks apart for exudative age - related macular degeneration ( amd ) in the right eye .
five days after the second injection , the patient reported tearing , light sensitivity , and decreased vision .
slit lamp biomicroscopy revealed 1 + conjunctival vascular injection , 1 + corneal edema with intact epithelium , and 1 + flare .
a diagnosis of  decompensated corneal dystrophy was made and sodium chloride hypertonicity ophthalmic ointment 5% ( muro-128 , bausch and lomb , rochester , ny ) and prednisolone acetate 1% were initiated .
the visual acuity and ocular findings reportedly returned to baseline within 1 week . on initial presentation at our center 4 months later , the best corrected visual acuity was 20/30 .
slit lamp biomicroscopy revealed anterior basement membrane dystrophy but no other corneal pathology or intraocular inflammation .
dilated fundoscopic examination revealed asteroid hyalosis and a serous pigment epithelial detachment without subretinal fluid or hemorrhage .
two months later , the visual acuity dropped to 20/70 , and the pigment epithelial detachment increased in height on optical coherence tomography ( oct ) .
the patient underwent a series of 3-monthly intravitreal ranibizumab ( 0.5 mg/0.05 ml ) injections without incident , consistent with reports in the literature supporting the use of anti - vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) therapy to treat amd - associated serous pigment epithelial detachments.5,6 the visual acuity subsequently improved to 20/40 with marked resolution of the pigment epithelial detachment on oct .
due to patient preference and the diagnostic ambiguity of the original event , maintenance therapy was initiated with a retrial of bevacizumab .
twelve days later , the patient noted tearing , light sensitivity , and pain in the eye .
slit lamp biomicroscopy revealed 2 + conjunctival vascular injection , corneal edema , and 2 + cell and flare .
the patient was treated with topical prednisolone acetate 1% and homatropine 5% for acute anterior uveitis , and the symptoms resolved completely within 4 weeks .
a 69-year - old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and primary open - angle glaucoma received a diagnosis of bilateral exudative amd after reporting a 6-week history of decreased vision .
he was initially treated with monthly ranibizumab injections ( two in each eye ) before switching to bevacizumab .
he continued to receive intravitreal bevacizumab injections in each eye every 8 weeks for the next 2 years without complication .
four days after a routine bevacizumab injection in the left eye , he noticed increasing redness and foreign body sensation .
the visual acuity dropped from 20/25 to 20/40 and slit lamp examination revealed keratic precipitates with trace cell in the anterior chamber .
he subsequently received intravitreal ranibizumab injections in each eye every 6 weeks , and tolerated the therapy well with no evidence of recurrent uveitis .
the anti - vegf agents , bevacizumab and ranibizumab , have enhanced the management of exudative amd.2 however , the safety profile of these drugs continues to undergo scrutiny , and noninfectious intraocular inflammation is a known adverse effect of both drugs.1 a retrospective case series of nearly 2000 injections reported no significant difference between the incidence of post - injection anterior uveitis ( 1.57% bevacizumab vs 1.38% ranibizumab ; p > 0.80 ) or panuveitis ( 0.39% vs 0.41% ; p = 1.0).3 however , randomized prospective trials comparing the rates of uveitis between ranibizumab and bevacizumab are lacking , leading some authors to question whether the complication rates are truly similar.4,7 although underpowered to compare this relatively rare outcome , the 1-year clinical trial results from the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trials reported anterior uveitis in < 1% of study eyes receiving either treatment.8 in retrospect , we believe that the first case was bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis that was originally misdiagnosed .
amd treatment later resumed uneventfully with ranibizumab and was then switched to bevacizumab for maintenance therapy .
the anterior uveitis promptly relapsed . to our knowledge , this is the first report in the literature to describe recurrent bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis following a retrial of intravitreal bevacizumab .
the second patient likely experienced bevacizumab - related anterior uveitis after previously tolerating the medication without difficulty , which has been reported.9 his case is unique in that he was receiving bilateral bevacizumab injections , yet developed only unilateral anterior uveitis .
both cases corroborate reports from raja et al10 and georgopoulos et al14 describing the safe administration of intravitreal ranibizumab after bevacizumab - related uveitis .
the etiology of this drug - induced uveitis is speculative at best , since it occurs rarely and there is no histopathologic data with which to correlate the phenomenon .
the following mechanisms have been proposed : ( 1 ) toxic response to the drug or excipients ; ( 2 ) direct blood - aqueous or blood - retinal barrier compromise by drug or excipients ; ( 3 ) immune response to the drug or excipients ; and ( 4 ) rebound inflammation secondary to vegf suppression.11 the excipients of both preparations are nearly identical : trehalose dihydrate , sodium phosphate , polysorbate 20 , and sterile water ( histidine hydrochloride  in ranibizumab only ) , which makes it more difficult to implicate them in a differential immune response
. moreover , there are no reported cases of hypersensitivity to any of these excipients in the literature .
alternatively , this reaction may occur as an immunologic response to the fc protein portion of the full - length antibody molecule itself ; ranibizumab is an fab fragment whereas bevacizumab is a full - length antibody ( fab and fc ) derived from the same parent molecule .
this is an attractive explanation since other drugs , such as heparin , provoke a differential immune response based on antigenic load .
unfractionated heparin has a higher propensity to cause heparin - induced - thrombocytopenia than low - molecular weight heparin , presumably due to the larger size of the full heparin molecule and its enhanced ability to form immunogenic complexes with other platelet factors.12 the exact immunologic mechanism underlying these cases of uveitis is difficult to ascertain without histopathologic data , though a delayed - type hypersensitivity reaction seems possible given the several - day lapse in time between exposure to bevacizumab and the onset of uveitis symptoms .
interestingly , reports in the cancer literature show that infusions of monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab cause immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the majority of cases , though delayed - type reactions can be seen in up to 30% of patients.13 aside from the obvious difference in molecular size between ranibizumab and bevacizumab , it is also possible that differences in drug production could explain the variation in immunogenicity.14 bevacizumab is harvested as a glycosylated product of human ovarian cancer cells , whereas ranibizumab is a non - glycosylated product of bacterial metabolism .
the glycosylation of bevacizumab creates more potential immunogenic sites compared to the non - glycosylated ranibizumab , which could translate into a higher propensity for bevacizumab to cause inflammatory reactions .
furthermore , it is interesting to speculate on how the variable dosing regimens for bevacizumab and ranibizumab may contribute to the development of inflammatory complications .
the predominant anti - vegf dosing schedules used for amd treatment include fixed monthly injections ,  treat and extend , and as - needed ( pro re nata [ prn ] ) injections based on symptoms and oct findings .
we could not find anything in the literature to suggest that one dosing regimen may result in more complications than another , though it would seem reasonable to postulate that more frequent exposure to a drug could result in a higher likelihood of it causing inflammatory/ immunogenic complications .
data from the second year of the comparison of age - related macular degeneration treatment trial may help to more fully elucidate the role that anti - vegf dosing schedules play in predisposing patients to inflammatory ocular complications . despite our conjecture regarding the enhanced immunogenic potential of bevacizumab over ranibizumab , a large retrospective study failed to detect a significant difference in the rates of uveitis between the two drugs.3 nevertheless
, bevacizumab has not been subjected to nearly the same scrutiny ( in the form of rigorous clinical trials ) as ranibizumab , and thus safety data for bevacizumab is relatively lacking.4 the results of future prospective randomized trials comparing the efficacy and side - effect profile of ranibizumab to bevacizumab might help to more definitively answer the questions surrounding the inflammatory sequelae of intravitreal ranibizumab and bevacizumab injections ."

Discussion"
83	"the term cardiorenal syndrome has been introduced recently in an attempt to emphasize the tight interaction between the cardiovascular and renal systems in acute or chronic disease settings and to expand our knowledge regarding its pathogenesis , prevention , and potential treatment .
the definition encompasses different syndromes , all involving the heart and the kidney ,  whereby acute or chronic dysfunction of one organ may induce an acute or chronic dysfunction of the other  .
according to the site of the initial injury and the acute or chronic nature of the process five distinct syndromes ( types ) are defined . in acute cardio - renal syndrome ( type 1 ) ,
acute worsening of heart function leads to acute renal dysfunction . in chronic cardiorenal syndrome ( type 2 )
, chronic cardiac dysfunction leads to chronic renal dysfunction . in acute renocardiac syndrome ( type 3 )
, acute renal dysfunction causes cardiac dysfunction , and in chronic renocardiac syndrome ( type 4 ) , chronic renal dysfunction leads to cardiovascular disease and increased cardiovascular mortality .
finally , type 5 , or secondary cardiorenal syndrome , involves systemic conditions such as diabetes mellitus , amyloidosis , systemic lupus erythematosus , or sepsis , which simultaneously affect both the heart and the kidney .
this paper will focus on cardiorenal syndrome type 4 ( chronic renocardiac syndrome ) presenting epidemiologic evidence of excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) as well as current knowledge on the pathogenesis and management of this syndrome .
ckd is defined as either a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) to values below 60  ml / min/1.73  m , or the presence of kidney damage as reflected in an abnormal urine sediment ( proteinuria , hematuria , and casts ) or abnormalities in renal architecture ( e.g. , polycystic kidney disease ) even if the gfr is preserved within normal levels .
gfr may be directly measured by renal clearance of specific substances ( e.g. , creatinine , inulin ) and radioactive markers ( e.g. , 99mtc - dtpa ) or it may be estimated ( estimated gfr - egfr ) , by the application of formulas incorporating serum creatinine and demographic parameters ( cockcroft - gault , mdrd ) .  
both proteinuria and the reduction of gfr have been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
this association is so strong and clinically relevant that according to current guidelines the diagnosis of ckd places a patient into the highest cardiovascular risk level , irrespective of stratification according to traditional cardiovascular risk factors [ 3 , 4 ] .
compared to the general population , ckd patients are still plagued by a frustratingly high mortality , which is mainly attributed to cardiovascular events , with death being far more probable than advancing into the final ckd stages and the need of renal replacement therapy ( rrt ) .
the high mortality afflicting patients on renal rrt , which for the ages between 25 and 35 may rise up to 375-fold compared to the general population , is derived almost by half of cardiovascular causes .
the abnormal quantities of protein in the urine ( proteinuria ) consist mainly of albumin ( albuminuria ) and can be semiquantitatively identified by urine dipstick testing , estimated by the urine protein - to - creatinine ratio ( upcr ) or albumin - to - creatinine ratio ( uacr ) in a spot urine sample , or directly measured in a timed ( usually 24  h ) urine collection [ 3 , 8 ] .
the diagnosis of microalbuminuria ( 30300  mg / day ) and albuminuria ( > 300  mg / day ) is mainly utilized in the evaluation of diabetic nephropathy , while proteinuria ( > 300  mg / day or upcr > 200  mg / g ) is mostly used for nondiabetic ckd .
whether considered a marker of systemic endothelial dysfunction or a result of renal damage , proteinuria has been associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in the general population , even at levels regarded as normal . in repeated studies ,
the presence of micro- and macroalbuminuria and egfr reduction were independent predictors of increased overall and cardiovascular mortality in diabetic   and nondiabetic individuals . in a recently published large community - based study involving nearly one million adult subjects ,
higher levels of proteinuria were independently associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and all - cause mortality , as were decreased levels of egfr .
the severity of proteinuria was actually a stronger predictor of worse clinical outcomes than was egfr reduction , a fact suggesting that levels of proteinuria may have a role in risk stratification of ckd patients , who are currently staged only according to their level of gfr .
irrespective of the presence of proteinuria , gfr decline has been repeatedly associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . in a large community study involving more than one million adults ,
an independent and graded association was observed between egfr reduction and increased risk of death and cardiovascular events including hospitalization for coronary artery disease , heart failure , stroke , and peripheral vascular disease . in middle - aged adults participating in the atherosclerosis risk in community ( aric )
study , a baseline egfr of less than 60  ml / min/1.73  m was independently associated with an increased risk of developing peripheral arterial disease   or heart failure , irrespective of prevalent coronary artery disease . according to united states
renal data system 2007 annual report regarding incident dialysis patients , comorbidities included congestive heart failure in 34% , atherosclerotic heart disease in 22.5% , cerebrovascular disease in 10% , and peripheral vascular disease in 15% of cases . in patients with already established cardiovascular disease
an inverse relationship between egfr and the extent of coronary stenotic lesions was shown , as well as increased probability of having three - vessel coronary artery disease with decreasing egfr . in a study of almost 15.000 patients , who had suffered myocardial infarction , even mild egfr reduction at baseline was independently associated with increased overall mortality or a composite end point of death from cardiovascular causes , reinfarction , congestive heart failure , stroke , or resuscitation after cardiac arrest . in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting ,
a reduced baseline egfr has also been associated with increased 30-day and long - term mortality .
furthermore , in patients with advanced congestive heart failure , impaired renal function seems to be a stronger predictor of mortality than impaired cardiac function ( left ventricular ejection fraction and new york heart association class ) .
finally , in a recent study also involving patients with heart failure , the presence of albuminuria significantly aggravated prognosis by exhibiting a strong and independent association with increased all - cause and cardiovascular mortality .
due to the vital importance for the rapidly growing population of ckd patients , the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to cardiovascular damage in renal disease are under constant investigation .
more than a dozen of pathways have been identified including hyperactivity of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system , osmotic sodium retention , volume overload , endothelial dysfunction , dyslipidemia , coagulopathy , inflammation , and anemia , all leading to histomorphological alterations of the heart and vessels .  
in addition , some key emerging topics in this field include sympathetic hyperactivity , cardiotonic steroids , nonosmotic sodium retention , and catalytic or labile iron .
sympathetic activation by the failing kidney leading to both renal disease progression and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality may provide a new target for therapeutic intervention .
cardiotonic steroids are elevated in renal failure and have been linked to hypertension and to the development of uremic cardiomyopathy in animal models .
nonosmotic sodium stores in the form of water - free na+ accumulation in the skin have been proposed to contribute to the development of hypertension and thus might be associated to ckd progression and cardiovascular complications .
finally , labile / catalytic iron is associated with oxidative stress in situations such as acute kidney injury after cardiac revascularisation and in diseases such as diabetes and may result in both kidney disease progression and cardiovascular complications .
however , an extensive analysis of all the above mechanisms lies outside the scopus of the present paper , and readers are referred to some excellent recent reviews [ 2528 ] .
this increase is the result of two separate pathways both leading to left ventricular hypertrophy ( lvh ) : pressure overload and volume overload .
pressure overload mainly derives from increased peripheral resistance and reduced arterial compliance due to sympathetic and renin - angiotensin system hyperactivity , hypertension , endothelial dysfunction , and vascular calcification / stiffening .
it causes thickening of cardiac myofibres by parallel addition of sarcomeres , thus leading to concentric lvh .
volume overload is attributed to sodium and water retention , anemia , and the presence of an arteriovenous fistula in patients with end - stage renal disease ( egfr < 15  ml / min/1.73  m anticipating or on chronic dialysis ) .
it results in lengthening of the cardiac myofibers by serial addition of sarcomeres thus causing eccentric lvh ( left ventricular dilatation ) [ 29 , 30 ] .
lvh in renal disease is a pathologic process and , unlike physiologic adaptations to increased workload ( e.g. ,  athletes heart  ) , is accompanied by fibrosis , which is also attributed to conditions related to the uremic milieu , including increased levels of parathyroid hormone , endothelin , aldosterone , catecholamines , and cardiotonic steroids [ 26 , 30 , 31 ] . in a study involving 432 esrd patients , only 16% had a normal echocardiogram at initiation of dialysis , the rest exhibiting mainly features of concentric lvh ( 41% ) and left ventricular dilatation ( 28% ) , both associated with increased risk of heart failure and death .
a more recent study demonstrated progression of concentric lvh in 576 new dialysis patients followed up by echocardiography .
in addition to fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy , histological changes of the heart in uremia also include myocyte apoptosis / necrosis resulting in myocyte number reduction , and microvascular abnormalities such as arteriolar wall thickening and capillary rarefaction , the latter being specific to uremia [ 29 , 34 ] .  
the functional consequences of all the aforementioned structural changes include diastolic dysfunction , increased oxygen demand and impaired , myocardial oxygenation unrelated to coronary obstruction [ 34 , 36 ] .
this may explain the angiographic finding of patent coronaries in 30%40% of uremic patients with ischemic heart disease / angina pectoris , as well as their predisposition to arrhythmias , both atrial and ventricular , and sudden death , which account for more than half of the cardiovascular mortality of patients on rrt [ 37 , 38 ] .
susceptibility to arrhythmias and sudden death may be further increased by coronary artery disease / myocardial infarction , left ventricular hypertrophy , congestive heart failure , electrolyte abnormalities , chronic fluid overload , anemia , autonomic imbalance , and inflammation .
ever since early reports of aortic thickening in uremic patients by richard bright in 1827 , renal disease has been associated with vascular pathology .
pathologic features include reduced elasticity / compliance of large arteries , as reflected in an increase of the arterial pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) [ 40 , 41 ] , thickening of the arterial wall , leading to an increased intima - media thickness ( imt ) , and , mainly , vascular calcification [ 43 , 44 ] .  
vascular calcification has recently been the focus of attention mainly because of its established association with cardiovascular mortality in ckd patients .
moreover , in the last decade , research has shown that it is not simply the result of passive mineral precipitation but rather an active and highly regulated process , closely resembling osteogenesis [ 43 , 46 ] , and is orchestrated by the arterial smooth muscle cell after its genotypic transformation to an osteoblast - like cell .
ossification of the arterial wall is favoured by conditions like ageing , diabetes , inflammation , and especially ckd . in renal disease , vascular calcification
is linked to hyperphosphatemia , lack of calcification inhibitors ( i.e. , fetuin - a , matrix gla protein , osteopontin , or pyrophosphate ) and derangements in regulators of mineral metabolism ( i.e. , vitamin d , parathormone , osteoprotegerin , and bone morphogenetic proteins ) , and abnormalities in bone turnover such as secondary hyperparathyroidism and adynamic bone disease [ 4648 ] .  
in addition , recent studies implied a role for the phosphatonin fibroblast growth factor-23 ( fgf-23 ) in the pathophysiology of chronic kidney disease  mineral bone disorder ( ckd - cmd ) and in vascular calcification .
fgf-23 levels are elevated in ckd patients both on dialysis and on conservative treatment and have been associated with increased mortality and left ventricular hypertrophy .
moreover , fgf-23 has been linked to increased arterial stiffness , endothelial dysfunction , and vascular calcification . however , a causative relation and its value as a marker of cardiovascular status and/or phosphate - related toxicity , as well as its potential role as a target for intervention , still await further clarification .  
calcium deposits may surround atheromatous plaques in the arterial intima ( atherosclerosis ) or involve the medial layer of the arteries ( arteriosclerosis  moenckeberg 's sclerosis ) .
they can be visualised in plain x - ray films [ 51 , 52 ] and quantified by more sophisticated and more expensive techniques like electron beam computed tomography ( ebct ) [ 53 , 54 ] , the latter regarding mainly coronary artery calcification ( cac ) .
because of the results from experimental models as well as their difference in histopathologic features , location in the arterial tree , and pathophysiologic consequences , they tend to be regarded as distinct   although this view has recently been challenged [ 55 , 56 ]
. both types of vascular calcification appear early in ckd , run an accelerated course , especially after rrt initiation [ 53 , 54 ] , and lead to high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality .
more importantly , a recent metareview on treatments for vascular calcification in ckd has demonstrated that no therapy to date , including statins and sevelamer , appears to influence their rate of progression .   in ckd patients ,
cac score measurement as a tool for cardiovascular risk stratification may be affected by the unique presence of medial coronary calcification [ 58 , 59 ] unrelated to obstructive coronary atherosclerosis , thus not necessarily leading to ischemia .
nevertheless , a high cac score has been associated with increased mortality in ckd patients both before   and after the initiation of dialysis .
apart from medial calcification , another feature characteristic of coronary artery disease ( cad ) affecting ckd patients is the location of culprit atherosclerotic lesions . in renal patients with acute myocardial infarction
, they were found to be located more proximal to the coronary ostia , which may account for the observed increased mortality .   because cad is highly prevalent in ckd patients ,
noninvasive screening tools for the prediction of asymptomatic coronary obstruction are needed . in recent studies ,
cardiac troponin t ( ctnt ) has emerged as a powerful predictor of multiple - vessel cad in asymptomatic hemodialysis patients [ 63 , 64 ] . in addition , the acute kidney injury biomarker neutrophil gelatinase - associated lipocalin ( ngal ) has recently been associated with both chronic renal impairment and cardiovascular complications and might potentially prove its worth as a cardiovascular risk predictor in ckd .
aortic calcification assessed by lateral abdominal x - ray has also been associated with all - cause and cardiovascular mortality in dialysis patients and has been proposed as a simple tool for cardiovascular risk assessment and treatment guidance [ 52 , 66 ] .
because of the heavy cvd burden affecting ckd patients , risk modification is vital in an effort to improve outcomes . still ckd patients are usually excluded from large interventional trials   because of their expected adverse outcomes , thus hindering the evaluation of therapeutic interventions . furthermore , interventions for traditional cardiovascular risk reduction already established in the general population have proved less effective in patients with ckd [ 24 , 68 , 69 ] .
this seems to result into a kind of  therapeutic nihilism  , by denying treatment despite the presence of sound indications , for example , the underutilisation of antiplatelets , statins ,  blockers , and ace inhibitors in ckd patients with known cad .
furthermore , ckd patients are less likely to undergo coronary angiography , percutaneous coronary intervention , or bypass grafting , or to receive adjuvant treatments , such as gpiib / iiia inhibitors .
strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in ckd patients should target both traditional and non - traditional , that is , ckd - related factors .
traditional risk factors include hypertension , dyslipidemia , diabetes , obesity , physical activity , and smoking habit , while ckd - related factors refer to ckd progression , proteinuria , anemia , inflammation , mineral and bone disorder , lvh , oxidative stress , coagulopathy , hyperactivity of the renin - angiotensin and the sympathetic nervous system , and dialysis dose and quality   ( table 1 ) . setting of specific treatment targets is complicated , especially in patients on rrt , by findings of reverse epidemiology with a u - shaped curve associating mortality with blood pressure , bmi , cholesterol , and phosphate , possibly a result of the malnutrition - inflammation - atherosclerosis ( mia ) syndrome frequently encountered in this patient population [ 72 , 73 ] .
further controversies also derive from recent results of increased morbidity and mortality in ckd patients associated with higher hemoglobin levels , intensive blood pressure   and glucose control , dual angiotensin ii blockade   and suppression of parathyroid function , and bone turnover [ 47 , 48 ] , which question the safety of overaggressive intervention on specific laboratory and clinical parameters in this patient group . rather than meticulously pursuing generalised targets ,
recent opinions suggest a potential benefit from a more individualised perspective , that takes into account patient - specific trends and distinctive dynamic features of the actual clinical situation [ 66 , 78 , 79 ] .  
eagerly awaited is the publication of results from large randomised studies evaluating therapeutic interventions to lower cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in ckd patients , such as the ongoing evolve ( evaluation of cinacalcet hcl therapy to lower cardiovascular events )   and the concluded sharp ( study in heart and renal protection ) .
the latter , a double blind placebo - controlled study involving almost 9500 ckd patients ( a third of them on dialysis ) in 18 countries , has been able to demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiovascular events , such as myocardial infarction , stroke , or need for coronary artery revascularization , with the use of a combination of ezetimibe plus simvastatin , according to most recent results presented during the american society of nephrology renal week 2010 . until further results are available , current recommendation for predialysis patients suggests regular exercise , where feasible , smoking cessation , blood pressure control to < 130/80  mmhg with preference to angiotensin - ii - targeted treatment , hba1c levels of < 7.0% , hb levels of 1012  g / dl , ldl cholesterol levels as for the general population with high cardiovascular risk , sodium intake < 2.4  g / day , maintenance of a bmi < 25  kg / m , treatment of proteinuria , and avoidance of nephrotoxicity , aiming , apart from cardiovascular protection , at renal function preservation and slowing of ckd progression [ 3 , 67 , 8284 ] .   for patients on dialysis , blood pressure of < 140/90  mmhg before and < 130/80  mmhg after dialysis is recommended .
optimal levels of hba1c and ldl - c seem to be less clearly defined , since they may not accurately reflect glycemic status   and atherogenic potential , mainly because of the short erythrocyte lifespan   and the qualitative rather than quantitative lipid abnormalities in uremia .
special consideration must be taken to mineral bone disorder aiming at normal phosphorus levels , avoiding hypercalcemia , and treating secondary hyperparathyroidism judiciously in order to maintain the mineral buffering ability of active bone turnover , in order to ameliorate vascular calcification .
the latter is portrayed in recent recommendations regarding vascular calcification screening , phosphate binder choice , and target levels of parathormone [ 66 , 87 , 88 ] .
also of importance are dialysis adequacy , quality , and hemodynamic stability , as well as the optimization of conditions regarding inflammation and dialysis - related infections [ 89 , 90 ] .   the treatment and prevention of arrhythmias and sudden death remains a challenge .
apart from attention to electrolyte disorders and avoidance of low - potassium dialysate , whenever possible , the use of  blockers seems beneficial .
ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor blockers appear promising but have yet to prove their efficacy in prospective trials .
implantation of cardiac defibrillators in dialysis patients is associated with increased risk for bleeding and infection . compared to patients with normal renal function
, their use for primary prevention in ckd patients confers a reduced survival benefit , possibly due to comorbid conditions or increased defibrillation thresholds . on the other hand ,
implantation for secondary prevention is underused in dialysis patients , despite a proven effect in reducing mortality [ 37 , 38 ] . in summary ,
this can be attributed to the high prevalence of traditional risk factors , such as advanced age , diabetes , and hypertension but also derives from ckd - related morbidity , such as sympathetic and renin - angiotensin hyperactivity , sodium retention , fluid overload , anemia , dyslipidemia , mineral - bone disorder and inflammation , which lead to structural alterations of the heart and vessels ( chronic renocardiac syndrome ) .
aggressive risk modification , high index of suspicion for cardiovascular morbidity , proper intervention , and secondary prevention are essential .
large high - quality trials involving ckd patients are urgently needed to provide results , which could support effective treatment strategies . until such results are available , avoiding  therapeutic nihilism  and aiming at established treatment targets with an individualised patient - oriented approach appears sensible ."	" the term cardiorenal syndrome refers to the interaction between the heart and the kidney in disease and encompasses five distinct types according to the initial site affected and the acute or chronic nature of the injury . 
 type 4 , or chronic renocardiac syndrome , involves the features of chronic renal disease ( ckd ) leading to cardiovascular injury . 
 there is sufficient epidemiologic evidence linking ckd with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality . 
 the underlying pathophysiology goes beyond the highly prevalent traditional cardiovascular risk burden affecting renal patients . 
 it involves ckd - related factors , which lead to cardiac and vascular pathology , mainly left ventricular hypertrophy , myocardial fibrosis , and vascular calcification . 
 risk management should consider both traditional and ckd - related factors , while therapeutic interventions , apart from appearing underutilized , still await further confirmation from large trials . "	"1. Introduction

85	"lewy body disorders ( lbds ) is an umbrella term that includes diseases with alpha - synuclein ( asyn ) aggregates as fibrils in lewy bodies ( lbs ) and lewy neurites .
several lines of evidence support a pathogenic role of misfolded asyn in lbds [ 13 ] .
parkinson 's disease ( pd ) without dementia ( pdnd ) is the most common subtype of lbds , followed by pd with dementia ( pdd ) and dementia with lewy bodies ( dlbs ) [ 4 , 5 ] . like in pd ,
the core feature of pdd is a diagnosis of pd according to the uk brain bank society criteria   but also includes cognitive symptoms severe enough to fulfil dementia criteria at least one year after pd diagnosis with insidious onset , slow progression , and impairment in more than one cognitive domain .
dlb is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative dementia after alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) .
clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of a dementia syndrome , accompanied by at least two out of the three following symptoms : fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness , visual hallucinations , and parkinsonism .
in contrast to pdd , the onset of dementia in dlb is before or within one year of any parkinsonism .
about one - fourth of lbds patients show cortical amyloid - beta ( abeta ) deposition , with the highest proportion in dlb subjects , followed by pdd subjects [ 914 ] . according to clinical , neuroimaging , and neuropathological data , co - occurrence of asyn and abeta
based on the central role that asyn and abeta play in the pathogenesis of lbds and the increasing body of literature pointing to defective clearance of misfolded proteins as a key mechanism to the pathogenesis of lbds , this paper aims at providing a condensed review of this latter topic .
although not exhaustive , it may provide a basic understanding of such mechanisms eventually contributing to the development of novel disease biomarkers ( which are currently not available [ 16 , 17 ] ) and neuromodulatory treatment strategies for these still incurable and chronic diseases .
the main ( intraneuronal ) pathways for the degradation and recycling of proteins are the ubiquitin / proteasome system ( ups ) and the autophagy - lysosomal pathway ( macroautophagy , microautophagy , and chaperone - mediated autophagy ( cma ) ) .  
the ups degrades short - lived nuclear and cytosolic proteins or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum .
it plays a key role in signal transduction , cell cycle progression , apoptosis , and cellular differentiation and has been implicated in several human diseases , including neurodegenerative diseases , cancer , inflammation , and autoimmunity [ 1820 ] .  
autophagy is a process involving the degradation of components inside lysosomes [ 21 , 22 ] .
it has a variety of physiological and pathophysiological roles in protein and organelle clearance , development , defence against microorganisms , cell death , and antigen presentation . in macroautophagy ,
organelles and macromolecular components are first surrounded by a double membrane , defined as the autophagosome or autophagic vacuole ( av ) , which then fuses with lysosomes to form autolysosomes . in microautophagy
, the transfer of cytosolic components the lysosomal compartment happens by direct invagination of the lysosomal membrane without prior sequestration into the autophagosome .
finally , in cma , individual proteins are targeted to lysosomes by the binding of a hsc70-containing chaperone / cochaperone complex .  
all these pathways are observable in neurons , and both impairment and excessive activation of these pathways are linked to neurodegenerative processes .
( extraneuronal ) clearance pathways include interaction of neurons with astro- and microglia and with infiltrating macrophages .
, other populations of cells may also act as phagocytes , including astrocytes , neural stem cells , and neurons [ 2528 ] .
there is no clear evidence for a defective protein clearance by the brain innate immune system as a primary pathogenetic event in neurodegenerative diseases .
however , phagocytosis of misfolded proteins by astro- and microglia triggers the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and reactive oxygen / nitrogen species , which may , under pathological conditions , further promote neuronal dysfunction and degeneration [ 29 , 30 ] .  
the adaptive immune system is also involved in the clearance of misfolded proteins in the brain .
naturally occurring autoantibodies are detectable in body fluids of healthy controls and in patients with neurodegenerative disorders [ 3133 ] .
finally , protein transport from the parenchyma to the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) and across the blood - brain barrier are relevant clearance mechanisms and have been shown to be affected in lbds .  
intra- and extraneuronal clearance mechanisms closely interact : as an example , protein aggregates can stimulate the cell surface innate immune receptors , initiating intracellular signaling cascades that , in turn , stimulate phagocytosis .
an overview of how these mechanisms may interact is schematically illustrated in figure 1 . in the following ,
all these mechanisms are discussed in more detail with special emphasis on asyn and abeta clearance .
abnormal deposition of asyn occurs early in the disease process of lbds and may follow an ascending pattern in most of the cases , starting from lower brainstem areas and then affecting limbic and cortical areas .
deposition may start even earlier in the autonomic peripheral nervous system [ 35 , 36 ] .
the mechanisms responsible for asyn degradation have been controversial , but it appears that , under normal conditions , asyn is degraded by both the ups and the autophagy - lysosomal pathway [ 3739 ] , whereas the autophagy - lysosomal pathway mediates clearance of accumulated and aggregated asyn . in agreement with this observation , activation of autophagy
leads to increased wild - type asyn clearance and neuroprotection [ 37 , 40 ] .
normal asyn binds to the cma - specific receptor lamp-2a on the lysosomal membrane and is subsequently degraded by cma .
however , mutant forms of asyn ( a53 t and a30p ) and asyn modified by dopamine tightly bind to the cma receptors on the lysosomal membrane and inhibit both their own degradation and that of other cma substrates [ 38 , 41 ] . the dysfunction of cma triggers neuronal dysfunction and increases vulnerability to stress .
interestingly , both mutant and wild - type asyn can decrease proteasomal activity and increase vulnerability to neurodegeneration , leading to a vicious cycle where an increased amount of intraneuronal asyn can block its clearance by itself [ 38 , 4246 ] .  
the main proteins involved in cma ( lamp2a and hsc70 ) are decreased in the sn and amygdala from pd patients .
microtubule - associated protein 1a/1b - light chain 3 ( lc3 , a marker for autophagic vacuoles ) colocalizes with asyn in most lbs and lewy neurites .  
genetic mutations leading to parkinsonism support the hypothesis that defective clearance mechanisms are centrally involved also in idiopathic forms of lbds . interaction between pink1 and parkin can modulate mitophagy [ 47 , 48 ] .
a reduced clearance of mitochondria was also demonstrated in cells lacking dj-1 which is another protein associated with recessive forms of parkinsonism .
mutations in the lrrk2 gene , the most common form of late onset autosomal dominant parkinsonism , may also cause neuronal cell death via impairment of protein degradation pathways as they influence the autophagy - lysosomal pathway , leading to asyn accumulation and aggregation [ 51 , 52 ] .
heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( gba ) convey an approximately 5-fold risk for pd .
these mutations are associated with lysosomal dysfunction and influence binding of asyn to its specific receptor at the lysosome membrane : a recent study demonstrated that the accumulation of the gba substrate glucosylceramide stabilizes asyn soluble oligomers which , in turn , can inhibit normal gba lysosomal activity .
the heterozygous gba mutation also seems to directly influence fatty acid metabolism : pd patients with these mutations have lower csf levels of palmitoleic , oleic , linoleic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic , and docosahexaenoic acids compared with both idiopathic pd patients and controls .  
although asyn is a cytosolic protein , a low quantity of the protein is secreted via vesicle exocytosis and is then present in biological fluids including plasma and csf [ 5557 ] .
the mechanisms responsible for the extraneuronal clearance of asyn are not entirely clear ; however , there is increasing evidence that adjacent cells such as astrocytes and microglia as well as the adaptive immune system and local protein transport mechanisms are crucially involved .  
loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and striatal degeneration can be preceded by neuroinflammation marked by activated microglia and an increase in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines [ 29 , 30 , 5862 ] .
, extraneuronal forms of asyn can activate glial cells and trigger inflammation and subsequent release of proinflammatory molecules , a common pathological hallmark of lbds [ 60 , 65 ] .
several studies have reported asyn - containing inclusions in astroglia of pd and dlb patients , and phagocytic microglial cells are very efficient scavengers of extraneuronal asyn aggregates [ 63 , 67 ] .
results of recent gwas studies argue for the relevance of the immune system , in the pathophysiology of lbds , as variations in the human leukocyte antigen ( hla ) region were associated with occurrence of lbds [ 68 , 69 ] .
this may also be mediated through microglia as these cells are capable of presenting antigens to lymphocytes   via the hla domain .
activation of hla - positive microglia is observable in affected brain regions of pd patients .
these results were basically confirmed by a recent study where serum asyn autoantibody levels were higher in demented lbds patients than in controls .  
an overload of local asyn can also occur due to defective transport mechanisms of asyn from the neuron to the csf .
most studies investigating csf total asyn levels in pd showed that these levels are reduced in the csf of pd patients compared to controls , whereas oligomeric asyn levels seem to be higher in pd compared to control csf [ 57 , 7377 ] .
a recent study showed that csf levels of phosphorylated asyn correlate weakly with pd severity and , if corrected for total asyn , contributed to the differential diagnosis between pd , multiple system atrophy ( msa ) , and progressive supranuclear palsy ( psp ) .
however , it is neither clear to date how asyn is transported from the parenchyma to the csf , nor why total asyn is reduced and pathological forms of asyn are elevated in the csf of pd patients .
comparable to lbds pathophysiology , in ad , only some rare genetic mutations lead to increased app expression or to changes in abeta stability or aggregation .
the common late onset sporadic ad seems to be far better explained by impaired abeta clearance mechanisms .
thus , assuming that similar mechanisms may occur in ( late onset ) ad and lbds and that abeta pathology is a pathophysiologically relevant feature of lbds , a discussion of ( ineffective ) abeta clearance mechanisms as they occur in ad may substantially contribute to our understanding of how abeta may ( or may not ) be cleared in lbds .  
there is convincing evidence from electron microscopy studies   that the autophagy - lysosomal pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of ad .
avs which are the major reservoir of intraneuronal abeta are abundant in affected neurons , especially in those with neurofibrillary tangles .
these studies argue for an impaired maturation of autophagolysosomes and impaired intraneuronal retrograde transport in ad .
defective clearance of abeta - generating avs may result in abeta accumulation [ 83 , 84 ] .
several further findings corroborate the hypothesis that impaired autophagy plays a key role in the pathogenesis of neuronal degeneration in ad .
beclin1 is decreased in ad brains , and decreased neuronal autophagy and subsequent lysosomal dysfunction and neurodegeneration are observed in mice carrying a heterozygous deletion of beclin1 .
presenilin 1 ( ps1 ) is essential for maturation of the lysosomal proton pump and affects autophagocytosis and protein turnover .
abeta concentration is tightly regulated by amyloid - degrading proteolytic enzymes and perivascular drainage [ 8789 ] .
neprilysin ( nep ) is an abeta - degrading protein found at presynaptic terminals and in body fluids [ 90 , 91 ] .
it is a preferentially membrane - bound , presynaptically located protein with an extracellular catalytic site which can degrade abeta [ 90 , 91 ] .
a soluble form of nep is detectable in body fluids such as blood and csf , emanating from a slow release from the membranes .
most interestingly , reduced csf nep activity levels have been shown to occur in early ad [ 93 , 94 ] .  
another protein involved in defective clearance mechanisms in ad is cystatin c. neurons , among other cells , are able to produce and secrete this protein
. fourfold higher levels of cystatin c in the csf than in blood   indicate a relevant role of the protein in cns pathways .
there is evidence that ad patients have reduced csf cystatin c levels [ 99 , 100 ] .
this makes it intriguing to hypothesize that a deficient abeta - binding capacity , as induced by a lack of ( functional ) cystatin c , may contribute to the amyloidogenic process in ad .
indeed , increased expression of this protein has been shown to reduce parenchymal abeta load in mouse models of ad [ 101 , 102 ] .
of note , the bb genotype of the cystatin c - encoding gene  which leads to reduced cystatin c secretion from the neuron to the extracellular space [ 103 , 104]conveys susceptibility to ad .  
inflammatory reactions , characterized by activated microglia and astrocytes surrounding amyloid deposits , are intimately associated with the onset and progress of ad [ 106108 ] .
reactive astrocytes with abeta - positive granules are found in close proximity to amyloid plaques .
human astrocytes express scavenger receptors and several abeta - degrading enzymes such as nep , insulin - degrading enzyme ( ide ) , endothelin - converting enzyme ( ece ) , angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) , plasminogen activators , and the matrix metalloproteinases-9 and -2 ( mmp-9 , mmp-2 ) [ 109112 ] .
clinicopathological studies suggest that microglial activation is an early event in ad pathology [ 113 , 114 ] .
activated microglia surround amyloid fibril deposits , and postmortem studies have shown significant amounts of abeta in microglial cells of ad patients treated with immunization therapy [ 115 , 116 ] .
microglia express toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) , a family of highly conserved molecules that recognize pathogen - associated molecular patterns , including both exogenous and endogenous ligands .
tlr2 and tlr4 have been associated with the removal of abeta , indicating that the innate immune system plays a key role in preventing the brain from abeta deposits [ 118120 ] .  
in addition , the adaptive immune system is obviously involved in cns parenchyma clearance mechanisms . naturally occurring antibodies directed against abeta
have been detected in the csf and plasma of patients with ad and healthy control subjects .
some studies have shown reduced csf levels of anti - abeta antibodies in patients with ad compared with healthy control subjects [ 32 , 121 ] and in individuals at increased risk for ad .
another study reported that a subset of conformation - specific , cross - reactive antibodies that may protect against amyloidogenic toxic peptides are reduced in ad patients .
as a consequence of these findings , a number of phase ii and iii clinical trials are currently under way to test the effect of such autoantibodies in ad patients .
first results are promising : a recent study using carbon 11-labeled pittsburgh compound b ( [ 11c]pib ) positron emission tomography ( pet ) has shown that passive immunization can reduce the level of brain amyloid in vivo after 18 months of antibody treatment .
to the best of our knowledge there is no study available that investigated intraneuronal mechanisms of abeta clearance in lbds .
there is however indirect evidence that deficits of ( intraneuronal ) defence mechanisms against abeta toxicity may exist , at least in demented lbds patients .
we recently showed that csf levels of uric acid , an antioxidant detectable in neurons and associated with pd progression , were significantly lower in demented than in nondemented lbds patients .
in addition , these levels correlated positively with csf abeta42 levels , with highest correlation values in controls and lowest in demented lbds patients . in the light of the recent
finding that csf abeta levels increase within hours after trauma and thus reflect a sufficient and fast response to neuronal stress , a weak correlation of csf abeta42 with uric acid may indicate deficits in this repair mechanism .  
lowered csf nep activity levels have been found in demented lbds patients , compared to nondemented lbds patients and controls .
these data argue for a role of nep in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline in lbds .  
also cystatin c seems to be relevantly involved in abeta - associated cognitive decline in lbds .
our group investigated csf and serum levels in lbds patients   and found lower csf cystatin c levels in demented lbds patients compared to pdnd and controls . in additions ,
these levels correlated positively with age at onset of dementia but not with parameters associated with parkinsonism .
notably , the correlation between csf cystatin c and csf abeta42 levels was highly significant in nondemented individuals , but not significant in demented patients .
this indicates that cystatin c - related abeta transport from the neuron to the csf is impaired in demented lbds patients .
the risk genotype of the cst3 gene , bb , was detectable only in demented lbds patients and was associated with low csf cystatin c levels .
the role of the innate immune system in abeta clearance in lbds is not well understood although neuroinflammatory reactions are a common finding in lbds and are considered to play a key role in the neurodegenerative process .
activated microglia is associated with asyn - positive oligodendrocytes in msa patients and in an animal model of this disease [ 131 , 132 ] .
astrocytic abnormalities also occur [ 133 , 134 ] .   the adaptive immune system is also involved in abeta - associated mechanisms in lbds .
autoantibodies against abeta were elevated in serum and csf of demented lbds patients , compared to controls and were even higher than in other forms of dementia such vascular dementia .
still , many questions remain about the contribution of the immune system , such as microglia , macrophages , and t cells but also other immune cells , to clearance of misfolded proteins in the cns .
although many questions remain open , recent literature suggests that impairment of protein clearance is one of the key factors mediating the degeneration of vulnerable neuronal populations in lbds .
an improved understanding of such pathways can provide the basis for new developments in the biomarker era and , ultimately , contribute to the development of neuromodulatory or even causal treatment strategies ."	" protein clearance is critical for the maintenance of the integrity of neuronal cells , and there is accumulating evidence that in most  if not all  neurodegenerative disorders , impaired protein clearance fundamentally contributes to functional and structural alterations eventually leading to clinical symptoms . 
 dysfunction of protein clearance leads to intra- and extraneuronal accumulation of misfolded proteins and aggregates . 
 the pathological hallmark of lewy body disorders ( lbds ) is the abnormal accumulation of misfolded proteins such as alpha - synuclein ( asyn ) and amyloid - beta ( abeta ) in a specific subset of neurons , which in turn has been related to deficits in protein clearance . in this paper 
 we will highlight common intraneuronal ( including autophagy and unfolded protein stress response ) and extraneuronal ( including interaction of neurons with astrocytes and microglia , phagocytic clearance , autoimmunity , cerebrospinal fluid transport , and transport across the blood - brain barrier ) protein clearance mechanisms , which may be altered across the spectrum of lbds . 
 a better understanding of the pathways underlying protein clearance  in particular of asyn and abeta  in lbds may result in the identification of novel biomarkers for disease onset and progression and of new therapeutic targets . "	"1. Introduction

86	"normally , a diverticulum is present in fetal life as the vitello - intestinal duct remnant , which usually disappears later on the 7th week of gestational period .
md occurs in about 2% of the population , with a male - to - female ratio of 2:1 .
it is located within two feet from the ileocecal valve , and it can be 2 in . in length and may vary based on clinical practice .
most cases of md are difficult to diagnose and are found incidentally during a surgical procedure for another reason . however ,
we describe a case of an adult female patient who presented with clinical picture of acute bowel obstruction due to md .
a 39 year old female patient known for hypothyroidism on thyroxine presented to king abdulaziz university hospital , emergency department , with a complaint of abdominal pain for 3 days .
then , it shifted to the right iliac fossa on the day of her er visit .
it was associated with vomiting , greenish in color , three times on the same day of presentation , in addition to history of constipation for 2 days .
there was no history of fever , diarrhea , bleeding per rectum , or urinary symptoms .
the abdomen was mildly distended . during palpation , the abdomen was soft and lax , with guarding in the right iliac fossa .
routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits : wbc 8.7  k/l , hb 15  g / dl , plt 240 , na 129  mmol / l , k 4.1  mmol / l , urea 4.1  mmol / l , and creatinine 41  mol / l . urine analysis was unremarkable .
erect abdominal x - ray was performed , and it revealed multiple air fluid levels with dilated small bowel loops and no free air .
she was kept npo on intravenous fluid resuscitation , nasogastric tube was inserted , and urine output was measured . in order to identify the cause of the bowel obstruction , a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis was performed as well , and it revealed multiple dilated loops of small bowel , reaching the maximum diameter of 4  cm with few air fluid levels .
there was a transitional point in the right iliac fossa , with whirling of the mesenteric vessels .
there was a diffuse wall thickening and an enchantment of the cecal wall with possible pneumatosis .
mild surrounding inflammatory changes were seen with minimal free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis .
meckel 's diverticulum was found to be perforated and adherent to the right lower abdominal wall ( fig .
a limited resection of involved part of ileum with the md was performed with subsequent primary anastomosis , in addition to appendectomy .
it was named after johann friedrich meckel , a german anatomist who described the features of md .
it is a true congenital diverticulum as it consists of all the three layers of the bowel wall and is usually found on the anti - mesenteric border of the ilium .
the average distance of the meckel 's diverticulum from the ileocaecal valve is 67  cm in adult population .
it can either be asymptomatic or mimic common abdominal disorders such as appendicitis , peptic ulcer disease and crohn 's disease .
however , they have been known to cause complications , including diverticulitis , intussusception , severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage , perforation , peptic ulceration and intestinal obstruction . yet ,
obstruction can be caused by trapping of a bowel loop by a mesodiverticular band , intussusception , a volvulus of the diverticulum around a mesodiverticular band , or an extension into a hernia sac called littre 's hernia .
the case described above presented with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute intestinal obstruction and radiological findings suggestive of cecal volvulus .
this patient had partial intestinal obstruction caused by adhesions of the diverticulum with the abdominal wall , causing cecal volvulus as discovered intraoperatively .
ct scan , technetium-99 m pertechnetate scan , abdominal ultrasound , and barium studies are all useful in the diagnosis of md . after diagnosing md , the mainstay treatment would be diverticulectomy in all symptomatic cases .
resection should always include the diverticulum or the segment of the bowel affected by the pathology . for asymptomatic md , evidence does not support elective resection of meckel 's diverticulum . in a systemic review , zani et al .
stated that  a large number of md resections would need to be performed to prevent 1 death from md  .
hence , avoiding surgery in case of asymptomatic md reduces the risk of postoperative complications caused by unnecessary surgical intervention .
although , md is the most common congenital condition of the gi tract , the clinical diagnosis of md is difficult to make .
ct scan can help identify the cause of bowel obstruction , but it may miss the diagnosis of md . hence , md is mostly identified during the operation .
appropriate knowledge of various pathophysiologies by which a meckel 's diverticulum can cause complication must be kept in mind for a better management without recurrences .
he was informed that this case will be written for publication as a case report with the accompanying images .

87	"western flower thrips ( wft ) , frankliniella occidentalis , is a highly polyphagous insect that causes both direct and indirect effects on plant development and health .
the adults and larvae feed on epidermal and subepidermal cells of both meristematic and mature leaf and flower tissues , inhibiting plant growth and development and causing necrotic or light - reflective blotches on the tissue .
furthermore , they indirectly damage plants by transmitting tospoviruses such as tomato spotted wilt virus ( reitz , 2009 ) . as a result
, wft has become the most serious pest in several vegetable and flower crops world - wide ( daughtrey et al . , 1997 ; reitz , 2009 ) .
the widespread use of chemical insecticides to control wft has led to increasing resistance against the major classes of synthetic insecticides ( broadbent and pree , 1997 ; flanders et al . , 2000 ; broughton and herron , 2009 ) . the growing awareness and demand for insecticides that are not environmentally hazardous has stimulated the study of plant - derived compounds for pest control ( boeke et al . , 2004 ) .
such compounds could be used as natural pesticides , and in theory , genes responsible for the biosynthesis of those compounds could be isolated and transferred to crops to improve plant defense against wft ( annadana et al . , 2002 ;
among the sources of botanical pesticides , pyrethrins from pyrethrum plants ( tanacetum cinerariifolium ) represent the economically most important class of compounds with broad usage both in homes and organic agriculture ( casida , 1973 ) .
pyrethrins are neurotoxins that bind to voltage - gated sodium channels of neuronal cells , causing the channels to remain open ( davies et al . , 2007 ) .
pyrethrins comprise a group of six closely related esters , named pyrethrin i and ii , cinerin i and ii , and jasmolin i and ii . they are found in all aboveground parts of the pyrethrum plants , but predominantly in the ovaries of the flower heads ( brewer , 1973 ) . on average , the concentration of pyrethrins is about 0.1  % ( dry weight ) in leaves and 1 - 2  % ( dry weight ) in flowers ( baldwin et al . , 1993 ) . assuming a water content of 90  % , pyrethrins account for around 0.01  % of the fresh weight of leaves and 0.1 - 0.2  % of the fresh weight of flowers .
pyrethrins are effective against a broad spectrum of insects , while their toxicity for mammals is very low , allowing their use as a preharvest spray ( casida and quistad , 1995 ; schoenig , 1995 ) .
western flower thrips are sensitive to synthetic pyrethroids ( thalavaisundaram et al . , 2008 ) , but there is no report on the effect of natural pyrethrins against wft .
pyrethrins might provide pyrethrum with a broad range protection against many different insect pests , but the role of pyrethrins in pyrethrum defense has not been studied . in initial experiments , we observed that wft adults died within one day when fed pyrethrum leaves , but that they were abundant in open flowers . here , we tested the hypothesis that pyrethrins are responsible for protecting pyrethrum leaves against wft by assessing adult and embryo toxicity , and by examining feeding and oviposition deterrence both in vitro and in planta .
a pyrethrum field close to luxi , yunnan province , china , was used for surveying thrips populations ( 2427'10.34""n-10332'21.01""e ) .
the field was 0.5  ha in size , and the presence of insect species was monitored during the flowering period of spring 2010 , when the flowers were predominantly in developmental stages 25 [ numbered according to casida ( 1973 ) ] . to assess populations of small resident insects including thrips , flowers at each developmental stage
each flower was taken by the stem and turned upside down into a jar containing 75  % alcohol .
the procedure was repeated until each jar contained the insects from 100 flowers from a single block and at a particular stage .
the number of insects of each species for each stage was scored . in the case of thrips ,
the number of adults and larvae were scored separately . among all collected thrips , 30 were randomly picked and identified , where possible to the species level .
a population of wft was mass - reared on flowering chrysanthemum ( chrysanthemum morifolium ramat . )
sunny casa in a greenhouse under a photoperiod of l16:d8 at 25    2c . in this study ,
the chrysanthemum plants used for bioassays were from the same cultivar , but were grown in an insect - free compartment of the greenhouse under the same light and temperature conditions .
all bioassays were conducted in a climate room at 2022c with a l16:d8 photo regime .
pyrethrum oil ( 70  % w / w ) had been extracted from dried and ground pyrethrum flower heads with liquid co2 leaving no solvent residue ( honghe senju biological co. ltd . , yunnan , china ) .
butylated hydroxytoluene ( bht ) had been added to the oil ( 1  % ) to prevent oxidation .
we confirmed the concentration and composition of the oil by gas chromatography  mass spectrometry comparison to a pyrethrin standard ( nguyen et al . , 1998 ) . since the major insecticidal compounds in pyrethrum
have long been known as pyrethrins ( casida , 1973 ) , the effect of pyrethrum oil was considered to be the effect of pyrethrins . when calculating the concentrations of pyrethrins in different solutions ,
the percentage of pyrethrins in the oil ( 70  % ) was taken into account .
for example , 1  % ( w / v ) pyrethrins was prepared by dissolving 14.3  mg pyrethrum oil in 1  ml solvent . the toxicity of pyrethrins was evaluated by topical application to thrips ( robb et al . , 1995 ) .
pyrethrum oil was dissolved in acetone to achieve a concentration range of 1 to 30  mg pyrethrins per ml , and the solutions were applied to the thorax with a 10-l glass syringe at 1  l per thrips .
the droplet briefly covered the thorax of the insect and also the paper support before evaporating in a few seconds , leaving a residue both on the insect and the support .
after treatment , all thrips were transferred to petri dishes containing a piece of chrysanthemum leaf embedded in an agar substrate .
mortality was assayed after 24  h by counting the number of insects that did not respond to prodding with a fine brush .
six replicates were used for each concentration , and 10 thrips were used per replicate .
percent mortality was corrected for mortality observed in acetone control using schneider - orelli s formula ( schneider - orelli , 1947 ) .
a dual - choice leaf disk assay was used to determine the deterrent effect of pyrethrins on wft .
all leaf disks ( diam 1.6  cm ) were punched from chrysanthemum leaves of similar leaf age .
pyrethrum oil was dissolved in 0.2  % ( v / v ) aqueous tween-80 to achieve 3 concentrations of pyrethrins : 0.01 , 0.1 , and 1  % ( w / v ) .
control leaf disks were sprayed with solvent solution ( 0.2  % tween-80 ) , and test leaf disks were sprayed with the pyrethrin solutions using a potter precision laboratory spray tower , which produced a uniform deposit ( 3  l / cm ) of solution on the leaf disks .
groups of 10 wft were positioned between a control and a test leaf disk placed abaxial side up and 2  cm apart on a 1.5  % ( w / v ) agar - bed in a petri dish ( 7  cm diam ) .
after positioning the thrips , the petri dish was covered by a 120  m mesh size nylon mesh lid to prevent condensation .
the number of wft on each leaf disk was recorded 0.25 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 20 , and 28  h after the release of the wft .
each concentration was replicated with 12 leaf disks . at each time point , a student 's paired t - test was used to assess the significance of the differences in the mean number of wft between test and control .
oviposition - deterrent effects were assayed with a non - choice method slightly modified from annadana et al .
the assay was conducted in perspex ring cages ( 3  cm in length and 3.5  cm diam ) , which were closed with a nylon mesh at the bottom .
pollen of scotch pine ( pinus sylvestris l. ) was supplied in a small open tube as food source for wft . after placing 10 wft in a cage ,
the top was sealed with two layers of stretched parafilm , with 300  l aqueous solution in between the layers .
the solutions used were water , 0.2  % tween-80 , or pyrethrins at 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % dissolved in 0.2  % tween-80 .
wft were allowed to adapt to the diet ( pollen and water ) for 3  d , and then every day for 5  d fresh test solution was provided .
all eggs were deposited in the solutions , and were counted daily under a binocular microscope .
data were analyzed by a one - way anova and a mean separation test was conducted using lsd (   =  0.05 ) . around 200 wft were kept in a perspex ring cage ( 7  cm in length and 9  cm diam ) to allow oviposition in a water solution as described above .
eggs laid on the same day were collected with a fine brush under a binocular microscope and then transferred to 2 layers of filter paper in petri dishes ( 3.5  cm diam ) .
the filter papers were drenched in 300  l of assay solution ( water , 0.2  % tween-80 or pyrethrins at 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % in 0.2  % tween-80 ) so that each paper was fully wetted but had no excess solution . after transferring the eggs ,
the developmental status of eggs was monitored every day for 6  d. to facilitate the observations , the bottoms of the petri dishes were marked with lines that could be seen through the filter paper from the top , and the eggs were placed on filter paper along these lines .
this facilitated finding the eggs under the microscope , and the viability of hatched larvae was assessed in terms of their ability to move away ( > 0.5  cm ) from the hatch position .
data were analyzed by a one - way anova and mean separation test was conducted using lsd (   =  0.05 ) .
mature pyrethrum leaves were harvested in november from a field in the netherlands when they were still flowering ( 5159'22.08""n-539'44.75""e , wageningen ) .
two or three pieces of leaves were placed , abaxial side up , on 1  % ( w / v ) agar in a petri dish ( 7  cm diam ) . after transferring 10 wft to each petri dish ,
petri dishes with two leaf disks ( 1.6  cm diam ) of chrysanthemum leaves , with a total mass similar to the mass of the pyrethrum leaf samples , or with only agar were used as controls .
the mortality of wft was recorded daily for 3  d. to test the in planta activity of pyrethrins against wft , pyrethrins were infiltrated into whole chrysanthemum leaves as described by ratcliff et al .
leaf disks ( diam 1.6  cm ) were punched from the infiltrated leaves , avoiding the infiltration points so that wft would not contact pyrethrins directly except at the edge of the disk . in the initial experiments , we infiltrated only water into the leaves and determined that on average 29.1  mg (  2.1  mg ) water could be infiltrated into each leaf disk ( 6 replicates ) .
as the fresh weight of each leaf disk was on average 45.3  mg (  1.2  mg ) , we infiltrated 0.025 , 0.25 , or 2.5  % pyrethrins solution to bring the concentrations to 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % pyrethrins .
the assay and data analysis were conducted as described above for the choice assays with topically applied pyrethrins .
the number of wft on each leaf disk was recorded 0.25 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 20 , and 28  h after the release of the wft . to test the effects of pyrethrins on oviposition and hatching of larvae
, wft were assayed with chrysanthemum leaf disks as described by de kogel et al .
leaf disks were punched from untreated leaves , from leaves infiltrated with 0.2  % tween-80 , or from leaves containing 0.01 , 0.1 , or 1  % pyrethrins in tween solution .
wft were placed on leaf disks ( 1.2  cm diam , 2 wft / disk ) , which were embedded , abaxial side up , on agar in wells of 24-well greiner plates .
plates were covered with parafilm , and every well was carefully sealed by pressing the parafilm on the edge of each well .
wft were allowed to oviposit for 48  h and were then removed , with simultaneous assessment of mortality . subsequently , half of the leaf disks from each plate were used to determine the number of eggs , and the other half of the leaf disks were used to determine the number of hatched larvae . to determine the number of eggs
, the leaf disks were boiled in water for 3  min so that the eggs were clearly visible under a binocular microscope with transmitting light . to determine the number of hatched larvae , the leaf disks were transferred to petri dishes containing water and incubated in a climate chamber ( 25c , l16:d8 ) for 5  d to allow the larvae to hatch .
data were analyzed by a one - way anova and mean separation test was conducted using lsd (   =  0.05 ) .
our field survey in china showed that several thrips species were the most abundant ( 98  % ) insects on pyrethrum flowers ( table  1 ) .
in addition , a few nysius species ( heteroptera : lygaeidae ) ( 1.9  % ) and lacewing larvae ( neuroptera ) ( 0.05  % ) were found .
a total of 30 individuals were identified to species level ; the thrips species found were mainly thrips tabaci ( 44  % ) , frankliniella occidentalis ( western flower thrips , or wft , 25  % ) , and thrips flavus ( 22  % ) .
the number of thrips in flowers was dependent on the flower s developmental stage ( fig .  1 ) .
the number of thrips increased until stage 3 ( the first row of disk florets are open ) , and then decreased in later stages .
larvae accounted for 7 - 26  % of the total number of thrips per flower , depending on the flower developmental stage ( fig .

mortality could be as high as 80  % within 3  days , although the degree of mortality depended on the plant source ( data not shown ) .
when only water and agar were provided , with no plant - based food , only 20 - 30  % wft died in 3  days .
this showed that the mortality of wft was caused by a toxic principle of pyrethrum leaves rather than deterrence or starvation .
the toxic principle of pyrethrum plants against insects has long been known to be a group of 6 pyrethrin esters ( casida , 1973 ) .
we were , therefore , interested in specifically testing the effect of pyrethrins against wft . to determine the effects of pyrethrins against wft
, pyrethrins were tested in vitro at different concentrations on adult mortality , feeding , oviposition , and embryo development .
the mortality of wft female adults increased with the concentration of topically applied pyrethrins in the range of 1 to 30  mg / ml . probit analysis showed that the lc50 and lc90 of pyrethrins was 12.9  mg / ml ( with 95  % confidence limit of 10.9 - 14.8  mg / ml ) and 39.0  mg / ml ( with 95  % confidence limit from 30.7 to 50.4  mg / ml ) , respectively .
thrips were significantly deterred from feeding by 0.1  % and 1  % pyrethrins ( fig .  2 ) .
when given a choice between chrysanthemum leaf disks coated with 0.2  % tween ( control ) or 0.1  % added pyrethrins , after 2  h significantly more ( 61 - 77  % of thrips ) settled on control leaf disks .
within 1  h , 72 - 90  % of thrips chose control leaf disks .
for both concentrations of pyrethrins , the maximum deterrent effect was reached at 4  h. application of 0.01  % pyrethrins on leaf disks did not show significant deterrent effects except at the 4  h time point ( fig .  2).fig .

pyrethrins , well - known natural insecticidal compounds , are found exclusively in and extracted from the composite flowers of pyrethrum ( tanacetum cinerariifolium ) , which belongs to anthemideae tribe within the astaraceae family ( casida and quistad , 1995 ) . remarkably , the potential role of pyrethrins in pyrethrum plant defense has not been studied . here
, we report that western flower thrips ( wft ) adults thrive on pyrethrum flowers , but die within a few days on pyrethrum leaves . the hypothesis that pyrethrins are responsible for protecting pyrethrum leaves against wft was tested by spraying or infiltrating pyrethrins to leaves of chrysanthemum , a related pyrethrins - free species belonging to the same tribe .
we assessed toxicity to the adult and embryo stages of wft , and negative effects on feeding and oviposition both in vitro and in planta , and found that the natural concentrations of pyrethrins present in leaves have strong negative effects on wft .
we speculate that the thrips found on pyrethrum flowers survive on pollen that is devoid of pyrethrins ( t. yang , unpublished data ) . for many populations of wft
, resistance has been reported for some synthetic insecticides ( espinosa et al . , 2005 ) .
previously , several other plant - derived compounds were tested for their insecticidal effects against wft adults .
for example , carvacrol at 1  % and thymol at 0.1  % and 1  % significantly reduced the oviposition rate of wft when these compounds were sprayed on leaf disks , but neither compound affected the feeding activity of wft ( sedy and kosehier , 2003 ) .
salicylaldehyde ( 0.1  % and 1  % ) and methyl salicylate ( 0.1  % and 1  % ) were also tested . within 24  h of applying 1  % methyl salicylate to bean or cucumber , the feeding and oviposition activities of thrips females
the insect could be a result of changes in the plant induced by methyl salicylate , since it is a plant hormone involved in induced resistance ( pieterse et al . , 2009 ) .
a series of commercially available plant - derived essential oils tested at recommended concentrations ( 0.02 - 0.5  % ) , including neem oil , rosemary oil , peppermint oil , garlic oil , and cottonseed oil , caused less than 30  % mortality within 7  days ( cloyd et al . , 2009 ) .
our results showed that 0.1  % and 1  % pyrethrin solutions sprayed on leaf disks significantly deterred wft at 4  h , and topically applied pyrethrins were toxic to adults at an lc50 value of 12.9  mg / ml ( 1.3  % ) . by mimicking the natural site of pyrethrin accumulation by infiltration of leaves
, we found that 1  % pyrethrins caused 69  % mortality and completely inhibited oviposition .
furthermore , 0.1  % pyrethrins was strongly deterrent and resulted in abortion of 95  % of the embryos , while as little as 0.01  % pyrethrins caused 25  % mortality in 2  days .
we propose , therefore , that the natural concentrations of pyrethrin in pyrethrum leaves , around 0.01  % by fresh weight , accounts for the observed high mortality of thrips adults on this plant .
wft eggs are embedded in plant tissues ( childers , 1997 ) , and as a result they are unlikely to be affected by non - systemic chemicals that are applied on the surface of plants .
however , pyrethrins naturally accumulate inside pyrethrum tissues , stored in what appear to be unstructured intercellular cavities ( m.a .
jongsma , unpublished observations ) . therefore , besides feeding and oviposition deterrence , the embryo - toxic effect of pyrethrins is a third component that contributes to their effect for plant defense against wft ( figs .  4 and 5 ) .
compared to some synthetic insecticides , the toxicity of natural pyrethrins against wft in the absence of synergists was not high . in previous studies using topical application methods , the lc50 values of insecticides tested against susceptible wft strains ranged from 10 to 83  g / ml for pyrethroids , 20 to 960  g / ml for carbamates , and 49 to 522  g / ml for organophosphates ( espinosa et al . , 2005
the lc50 value of pyrethrins against wft by topical application was determined as 12.9  mg / ml , and the action of pyrethrins was , therefore , 10 to 1000-fold weaker than for these synthetic pesticides . on the other hand
, pyrethrins did show much stronger negative effects on feeding behavior and reproduction , which may be explained by the action of pyrethrins on the nervous system , resulting in disordered function of excitable ( nerve and muscle ) cells ( bradberry et al . ,
pyrethrins not only caused mortality of adults and embryos , but also significantly reduced oviposition ( table  2 ) .
all these factors together cumulatively affect the life history parameters . as a result wft damage on pyrethrin - containing leaves
we hypothesize that if plants such as closely related chrysanthemum species , which do not contain any pyrethrins , were genetically engineered to produce pyrethrins , their resistance to wft in leaves could be significantly improved ."	" pyrethrins are active ingredients extracted from pyrethrum flowers ( tanacetum cinerariifolium ) , and are the most widely used botanical insecticide . however , several thrips species are commonly found on pyrethrum flowers in the field , and are the dominant insects found inside the flowers . up to 80  % of western flower thrips ( wft , frankliniella occidentalis ) adults died within 3  days of initiating feeding on leaves of pyrethrum , leading us to evaluate the role of pyrethrins in the defense of pyrethrum leaves against wft . 
 the effects of pyrethrins on wft survival , feeding behavior , and reproduction were measured both in vitro and in planta ( infiltrated leaves ) . 
 the lethal concentration value ( lc50 ) for pyrethrins against wft adults was 12.9  mg / ml , and pyrethrins at 0.1  % ( w / v ) and 1  % ( w / v ) had significantly negative effects on feeding , embryo development , and oviposition . about 20 - 70  % of wft were killed within 2  days when they were fed chrysanthemum leaves containing 0.01 - 1  % pyrethrins . 
 chrysanthemum leaves containing 0.1  % or 1  % pyrethrins were significantly deterrent to wft . in a no - choice assay , 
 the reproduction of wft was reduced significantly when the insects were fed leaves containing 0.1  % pyrethrins , and no eggs were found in leaves containing 1  % pyrethrins . 
 our results suggest that the natural concentrations of pyrethrins in the leaves may be responsible for the observed high mortality of wft on pyrethrum . "	"Introduction

90	"oligomeganephronia is a type of renal hypoplasia characterized by a reduced number of nephrons and hypertrophic glomeruli enlarged in diameter . in regard to the aetiology , while it is not yet clearly known , inadequate embryonic development of the metanephric blastema during the 1420-week period interferes with the formation of the nephron .
low birth weight ( lbw ) and intrauterine growth retardation ( iugr ) are also related to oligomeganephronia .
cases related to 4p monosomy , pax-2 gene mutations   and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 ( hnf-1 ) mutation carriers   have also been reported . in most cases
, it begins with polydipsia and polyuria in early childhood , and then leads to end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) by school age ( early - onset type ) . in some cases ,
asymptomatic proteinuria prompts closer examination , including kidney biopsy , and leads to the diagnosis of oligomeganephronia by school age ( late - onset type ) .
we report , for the first time , three adult oligomeganephronia patients who have not yet developed esrd .

lbw is defined by the world health organization as a birth weight of < 2500 g. lbw has especially attracted attention as occurring more frequently in disadvantaged communities , in which there is often a disproportionately high incidence of adult cardiovascular disease , hypertension , diabetes mellitus and kidney disease .
it has been hypothesized that poor fetal growth results in a reduced number of nephrons and an increased incidence of renal disease later in life .
fewer nephrons with subsequent hyperfiltration and glomerulosclerosis in the remaining nephrons could lead to accelerated ageing and early loss of renal function .
this hypothesis is supported by the results of human post - mortem and animal studies , where low birth weight is found to be correlated with fewer nephrons , and thereby reduced kidney weight / volume .
case 2 was a lbw baby who was raised in an incubator because of weak suckling .
additionally , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( fsgs , perihilar type ) was found in the specimen from case 2 .
hodgin et al .   also reported an association between very low birth weight ( vlbw ) and fsgs . in this report , we analysed the number of glomeruli per renal cortical area [ normal value ( mean  sd ) : 3.2  1.2/mm ]   and glomerular diameter [ normal value ( mean  sd ) : 201  28 m ] . in two of our cases
( case 2 and case 3 ) , the results of a school urinalysis screening led to further detailed investigations ( table 1 ) .
the blood pressure abnormality did not develop until 35 years of age , and the patient remained free of symptoms , presumably because the reduction of glomerular number was mild .
this was probably due to the fact that the enlargement of the glomerular diameter was also mild in comparison with typical cases .
use of renin  angiotensin system inhibitors might have kept the serum creatinine values from worsening in these patients . in conclusion ,
histopathological and morphometric studies of kidney biopsies , conducted based on abnormal results of school urinalysis screening and detection of hypertension during medical check - ups , revealed a reduced number of enlarged glomeruli ( figure 1 ) .
clinical and pathological findings in late - onset oligomeganephronia nicu , neonatal intensive care unit ; esrd , end - stage renal disease . normal glomerular number ( mean  sd ) : 3.2  1.2/mm ."	" oligomeganephronia is classified as a subgroup of renal hypoplasia , characterized by histopathologic abnormalities which progress to end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) by school age . 
 we describe three adult cases of oligomeganephronia who have not yet developed esrd . 
 we performed a renal biopsy in all of them . 
 the pathological features , consisting of a reduced number of enlarged glomeruli , were diagnostic of oligomeganephronia . 
 it was assumed that the condition had not progressed to esrd in the patients because the degree of loss of glomeruli may have been milder than that in typical cases of oligomeganephronia . "	"Introduction

Discussion"
92	"it is an honor to review and comment on an article written by my dear friend jerry mcandrews .
one would think that , in more than 20 years , some of the issues of concern that mcandrews addressed should have been resolved or at least ameliorated to some degree .
when it comes to discussions about  chiropractic philosophy  or should i correctly say  philosophy of chiropractic ,  there seems to be no limit to the time required for dogma to disappear and credible information to take its place .
it is imperative that we develop a new understanding for how to build the bridge between philosophy and practice .
there can be no theory without new data to drive ongoing investigation , as well as no theory without a hypothesis to build upon . yet when it comes to relating to what constitutes the philosophy of chiropractic , we often believe in things without being able to disprove them .
thus , knowledge transfer to the profession is more difficult than anyone could have possibly realized .
mcandrews lamented that the distortion of what constituted philosophy that was being taught and perpetuated would thwart most efforts to truly understand the importance of philosophy and its applicability .
the following are my reflections on his article titled  the knowledge of our knowledge ,  and i offer suggestions for the chiropractic profession to consider as we continue to look at these issues .
no better quote could be proffered to discuss this topic than the words of co watkins , dc , who exhorted us to be  bold in what we hypothesize , but cautious and humble in what we claim !  this admonition may be one of the fundamental reasons for how and why the philosophical divide continues to exist .
the proponents of the limited approach to patient care ( limited to only the detection of subluxation ) suggest that , if one understands 
chiropractic philosophy ,  this understanding negates the need to do research and scientifically investigate these claims .
detractors on the other end of the spectrum , those who oppose this limited viewpoint , might go so far as to require scientific evidence and validation a priori for everything done in practice , which is neither reasonable nor realistic .
it would appear that somewhere in the middle lies a position that is valid and achievable .
mcandrews opines in his 1991 article that the meanings of the term philosophy are not well understood by the profession and , thus , this misunderstanding has enabled distortions and improper contexts to contribute to a philosophical divide .
the term and its multidefinitions have been polarizing to the profession to a point of creating a paralysis of forward movement .
the vitalistic and the mechanistic coalitions fight against each other ; and until there is a greater effort to test the testable and untestable components , the battles will likely continue . in 2012 ,
the issues regarding educational qualifications , research validity , and professional authority become extremely confusing when many of the issues being debated within the chiropractic community are not  philosophy  per se but are unfortunately linked to , or confused with , philosophy .
emotional tirades fill our publications , with disagreements ranging from opposing or supporting a modernized council on chiropractic education standard of accreditation to whether to oppose or support the use of additional modalities ( expanded state statutory authority to use prescription drugs ) .
the debate continues over the use of a professional lexicon that has no universal agreement by all participants .
for example , mandating the incorporation of , or eliminating , the term subluxation to describe the profession generates a volatile reaction bordering on blasphemy by a segment of the profession .
conversely , defining the chiropractic profession to include primary care physicians or chiropractic physicians brings about an equally intransigent position to another faction .
the list of disputed issues and the emotional temperature on both sides of the conflicting debate(s ) appear to have no limits , and all exist under the banner of difference of chiropractic  philosophy .  chiropractic has always faced a challenging conundrum regarding how it will be perceived by those within the profession and from powerful forces outside the profession . on one hand , there is an increasing body of evidence supporting the contention that health care must focus on health and well - being rather than simply attempting to find a cure in a pill .
the metaphysical belief system in and of itself has provided divisiveness by an underlying construct that suggests that these beliefs can not be scientifically validated .
this contention only provides food to fuel the allegation and appearance that cult - like dogma is in play .
the very act of holding oneself , or a profession , immune from critique creates the very foundation for ritual and dogma . as wartfosky stated , 
metaphysics , in introducing the conceptual models as an articulate , explicit object of criticism , represents the way back to a critique of the foundations of understanding .
 when a metaphysic holds itself immune from a critique then it degenerates into non metaphysical ritual and dogma . 
thus , as a profession , we must overcome these urges to  hold ourselves immune  and instead allow ourselves to critique our foundations .
the chiropractic profession has made previous attempts to investigate the principles of chiropractic . in the prior decades
, research was focused on double - blind controlled trials , which were perhaps not the most appropriate model for chiropractic research . moving away from that model was difficult because controlled trials were considered the criterion standard and chiropractic researchers wanted to engage in credible research .
this research void included both sides of the profession : those supporting the assertion and those repudiating the hypothesis . in fairness ,
valid research is expensive ; and there was limited access to research funding to engage in trials of the magnitude that would provide meaningful data .
however , this does not excuse the lack of focus by the profession in attempting to research these essential questions .
claims had to be supported by a footnote reference to its source and hypothesis required challenge by expecting claims to be submitted to refereed journals . 
yet even when attempts are made to potentially test the validity of the  subluxation syndrome ,  there is ridicule from scientific communities and confusion within the chiropractic profession .
unsubstantiated claims that subluxations influence organ systems , and therefore adjustments can effect a cure to these systems , continue to be proclaimed and yet remain largely unsupported by scientific inquiries that test these questions .
this is a contentious yet important differentiation between the pragmatic practitioner and the chiropractic scientist .
practitioners witnessing the daily benefits of providing spinal adjustments / manual manipulation to their patients never stop to ask the question that the chiropractic scientist does :  is the subluxation clinically relevant ?  this view is questioned from diametrically polar ends of a spectrum and provides the fertile ground to generate the ongoing seeds of discord because of misunderstanding rather than provide insight and clarity .
subluxation is an unchallenged notion for many in the chiropractic profession and is recognized as such by various chiropractic leaders .
mcandrews rightly viewed the philosophy of the science of chiropractic as referring to the explanation of the science of chiropractic .
science is ever developing ( and thus changing ) , so also does the philosophy of chiropractic develop ( change ) with it .
the two not only go hand in hand with each other , they essentially are each other .
 maybe if we can approach science and philosophy in this manner , we would be able to reach beyond our differences .
as we enter the second decade of the 21st century , we are still challenged to understand fully that the fundamental hypothesis of chiropractic has not yet been satisfactorily resolved .
the health care environment continues to evolve , and other professions may be moving into areas that we once thought were ours alone . a wave of  new medicine  theories and advancements has made the distinction between chiropractic and other healing methods more challenging .
pronouncements from biomedicine state that treating the body alone is not enough ; the mind can also play a critical role in the healing process .
medical physicians appear to be embracing a more holistic form of health care , seeking to heal the whole person .
treatments once considered fringe , including visualization , meditation , and hypnosis , are being prescribed alongside high - tech western medicine .
no other profession has been so aggressively attacked by medicine than chiropractic , which has always integrated  holistic  approaches to health . throughout these decades of vicious attacks ,
the chiropractic profession was the leading alternative health care group to provide an alternative philosophy of health .
chiropractic has developed different concepts of health care : the role of the provider , the role of the healer , and ultimately the health care encounter itself .
we have the potential to contribute to the philosophy of health and to change the health care paradigm from disease focused to wellness .
however , in doing so , we must profess our knowledge based upon evidence and not emotion .
for the chiropractic profession to advance , it is imperative that unsupported claims be eliminated from our paradigm .
chiropractic and the theories espoused for many decades appear to be gaining credibility and validity .
. we must be ready to accept the results of these investigations and either build upon that body of research or accept the findings and move in alternative directions that science will take us .
in doing so , we will contribute to the philosophy of health and perhaps help change a paradigm from disease to wellness based upon evidence and not emotion .
perhaps then the  knowledge of our knowledge  will be understood : mcandrews would be proud ."	" the chiropractic profession has struggled with how it is viewed and perceived by those within the profession and the powerful forces outside the profession . 
 this commentary suggests that the vast majority of professional unrest is largely due to lines drawn upon philosophical boundaries and how we perceive what we know . for the profession to advance , it is imperative that unsubstantiated claims are eliminated from our justification for being and that we continue to test theories using scientific methods . 
 theories espoused must be able to be supported by valid research , and we must be ready to accept the results of these investigations and either build upon that body of research or accept the findings and move in alternative directions that science will take us . 
 in doing so , we will contribute to the philosophy of health and perhaps help to change the health care paradigm from disease focused to wellness , which is based upon evidence and not emotion . "	"Introduction

Conclusion
Funding sources and potential conflicts of interest"
94	"the mumps virus is a single - stranded , nonsegmented , negative - sense rna virus belonging to the paramyxoviridae family .
mumps is an acute , self - limiting viral infection that causes nonsuppurative swelling and tenderness of the salivary glands .
however , the incidence of mumps has been reduced by high coverage with effective vaccines . since the measles - mumps - rubella ( mmr ) vaccine was incorporated into the national immunization program in korea in 1985
there continue to be mumps outbreaks every 4 to 5 years , and recently , the periodic epidemics of mumps outbreaks have been shorter than in the past .
however , it causes severe complications such as orchitis , pancreatitis , and meningitis , and at least one of these occurs in up to 42% of patients with mumps [ 2 - 4 ] . of these complications ,
testicular swelling and pain occurs 10 days after the onset of parotitis in 15 to 40% of males with mumps viral infection ; however , these symptoms can occur up to 6 weeks after the onset of parotitis .
the mumps virus damages the testicular tissue as a result of parenchymal edema . as a result ,
testicular atrophy is reported to occur in 30 to 50% of affected testicles and subfertility occurs in an estimated 13% of patients .
although there have been several reports examining the resurgence in mumps , there have been few studies of the characteristics of postpubertal mumps and mumps orchitis in patients after mmr vaccination .
.   reported on an outbreak of mumps in vaccinated males , but they did not include a description of mumps orchitis . to our knowledge , this is the first report describing postpubertal mumps orchitis in vaccinated korean males .
from january 2005 to december 2010 , 62 patients diagnosed with acute mumps orchitis were treated at korea university medical center . it was confirmed by questionnaire that all patients had been vaccinated with the mmr vaccine under the national vaccination system of the korean center for disease control .
patients who did not receive vaccination or had an unknown vaccination history were excluded from our study .
diagnostic criteria for mumps orchitis were complaints of testicular pain , swelling , and tenderness on palpation during the acute illness stage and serologic confirmation of acute mumps infection ( positive immunoglobulin [ ig ] m with negative or positive igg ) .
mumps - specific igm and igg were detected by using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay kit ( vircell , granada , spain ) .
optical density value above 1.1 were considered positive , those below 0.9 were considered negative , and those between 0.9 and 1.1 were considered indeterminate .
the patients ' previous history of mumps and vaccination status was obtained from the patients or their parents by questionnaire or telephone survey .
the characteristics of the clinical manifestations , such as incubation period , febrile duration , mean duration of orchitis , and hospital stay , were investigated .
other general symptoms , such as pyrexia , headache , and malaise , were reviewed through medical records .
laboratory findings such as serologic markers ( white blood cell counts [ wbcs ] , c - reactive protein [ crp ] , amylase , and lipase ) and urine analysis with urine culture were assessed .
sonographic findings of mumps orchitis , such as the degree of testicular swelling , bilaterality , and direction , were also investigated .
the clinical features in our patients were compared with the features of previous reports of unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis identified through literature review .
searched reports were limited to studies that investigated more than 10 patients with unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis .
patients were admitted to the hospital unless their general status allowed them to be treated as outpatients .
all patients were treated with bed rest , elevation of the scrotum , local cooling ( ice bag ) , and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or antipyretics ( acetaminophen ) .
the mean age of the 62 patients was 17.56 years ( range , 15 to 29 years ) .
it was confirmed by questionnaire that all patients had been vaccinated with the mmr vaccine under the national vaccination system of the korean center for disease control .
a total of 56 patients ( 90.3% ) had been in contact with a mumps - infected case .
all patients were serologically confirmed to have an acute mumps infection ( positive igm with negative or positive igg ) and were hospitalized for supportive treatment .
all 62 serum samples obtained at admission were positive for mumps igm antibodies , whereas 36 ( 58.1% ) were positive for igg antibodies ( table 1 ) .
the mean incubation period was 5.39 days ( range , 0 to 23 days ) , the mean duration of fever was 1.8 days ( range , 0.5 to 3 days ) , the mean duration of orchitis was 4.96 days ( range , 0 to 17 days ) , and the mean hospital stay was 4.88 days ( range , 0 to 10 days ) . with regard to general symptoms , fever was observed in 46 patients ( 74.2% ) , headache in 34 patients ( 54.8% ) , and myalgia in 32 patients ( 51.6% ) . also , 56 patients ( 90.3% ) had parotitis before the appearance of acute orchitis .
the mean wbc level was not elevated in any patients ( 8,396/l ; normal range , 4500 to 11,000/l ) , whereas the mean crp level was increased over the normal range ( 24.18 mg / dl ; normal range , 0 to 5 mg / dl ) , and the mean amylase level was 406.08 iu / l ( normal range , 28 to 100 iu / l ) ( table 1 ) .
scrotal ultrasonography revealed testicular swelling of > 20 ml in 17 patients ( 27.4% ) , between 15 and 20 ml in 12 patients ( 19.4% ) , and < 15 ml in 33 patients ( 53.2% ) ( table 3 ) .
bilateral orchitis was present in 4 patients ( 6.4% ) , and 58 patients ( 93.6% ) had unilateral orchitis .
right - sided orchitis was present in 31 patients ( 50% ) , and left - sided orchitis was noted in 27 patients ( 43.5% ) ( table 2 ) .
meningitis was present in 5 patients ( 8% ) , but there were no other complications , including pancreatitis ( table 3 ) . to compare the clinical features observed in our study with those of cases of unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis
, we reviewed the literature and found four articles that investigated more than 10 patients with unvaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis .
the mean duration of fever was shorter ( 1.8 days ) in the population of our study than in unvaccinated patients ( 3.5 days ) , and the incidence of bilateral orchitis was lower in our study .
however , the mean incubation period , the length of orchitis , and the length of hospital stay did not differ significantly from that in the previous reports ( table 4 ) .
complications such as meningoencephalitis , pancreatitis , and oophoritis or orchitis have been observed in up to 42% of patients with mumps . in the past
, populations not receiving the mmr vaccine clustered in large groups in secondary schools and colleges .
however , the incidence of mumps has been reduced by high coverage with effective vaccines .
however , recent mumps outbreaks have been reported continuously worldwide , even in vaccinated children .
immunization programs against mumps have influenced the age distribution , and recent outbreaks have mainly affected adolescents and young adults .
since the introduction of the mumps vaccine in 1967 ( the year the first mumps vaccine was licensed in the united states ) , a shift in the age of peak incidence of mumps from children aged 5 to 9 years in the prevaccine era to children and young adults aged 10 to 24 years has been observed .
this shift in the age at the appearance of mumps [ 13 - 16 ] from children to young adults means a shift toward a period during which the development of mumps complications , such as orchitis , is more frequent . as a result
, there has been a resurgence in mumps orchitis , with epidemics being reported more frequently . however , to our knowledge , there have been no reports about the clinical features of postpubertal mumps orchitis in patients who have received the mmr vaccine .
our survey revealed that all study patients had previously received the mmr vaccination in accordance with korean national immunization programs .
most patients with mumps orchitis are hospitalized because of high fever and severe testicular pain .
fevers are frequent in mumps orchitis , although leukocytosis or pyuria are not evident in most patients .
they reported that the interval between the initiation of treatment and the disappearance of fever averaged 3.6 days with antiinflammatory drugs administered for an average of 8.6 days .
in other studies , the mean duration of fever was about 2 to 5.4 days [ 10,11,14,15,18 - 23 ] . in our study , the mean duration of fever was relatively shorter ( 1.9 days ) , although treatment , including bed rest , scrotal support , local cooling , and antiinflammatory drugs , did not differ from other reports .
we found that the febrile duration was relatively shorter in vaccinated postpubertal mumps orchitis patients than in unvaccinated mumps orchitis patients .
in particular , testicular swelling can lead to a rise in intratesticular pressure followed by testicular atrophy .
ku et al .   measured the testicular volume of 21 patients with acute mumps orchitis and found a mean testicular volume of 18.1 to 19.2 ml . in the same study , 8 of the 44 measured testes ( 18.2% ) reached a volume of 25 ml .
measured the testicular volume in 12 patients with acute mumps orchitis , and the mean volume of the affected testicles by ultrasound was 18.5 ml . in another series of 11 patients with acute mumps orchitis , the volumes of the affected testes ranged between 15.2 and 47.5 mm ( mean , 27.2 mm ) . in our study , the volumes of the affected testes in 33 patients ( 53.2% ) were smaller than 15 ml , and severe enlargement of the testis ( > 25 ml ) was observed in only 7 patients ( 11.3% ) .
we think these results may lead to a lower incidence of testicular atrophy and subfertility , but unfortunately , we did not investigate the development of testicular atrophy and subfertility in this study .
mumps orchitis is generally unilateral , but occurs bilaterally in 15 to 30% of patients . in unvaccinated postpubertal males , casella et al .  
reported that 18% of unvaccinated postpubertal males suffered bilateral mumps orchitis , and ternavasio - de la vega et al .   reported the incidence of bilateral orchitis to be two times higher in young adults than in adolescents ( 29% vs. 13% , respectively )
. however , bilateral orchitis was present in only four ( 6.4% ) of the vaccinated postpubertal patients in our study .
our findings indicate that the clinical manifestations of mumps orchitis in vaccinated postpubertal males are milder than in unvaccinated patients .
the duration of fever was shorter , the incidence of severe testicular swelling was lower , and the incidence of bilateral orchitis was also lower compared with mumps orchitis in unvaccinated postpubertal males .
there have been no reports explaining the difference in clinical features of mumps orchitis in vaccinated postpubertal males .
park et al .   reported that the level of igg titers and the avidity index in vaccinated unaffected patients were not significantly different from those in patients with a past infection .
alternatively , the low igg avidity index of the vaccinated unaffected group may represent a qualitative limitation of vaccine - induced humoral immunity in mumps ; that is , failure to induce sufficiently mature antibodies , resulting in secondary vaccine failure .
although recently vaccinated patients have a lower igg avidity , their igg avidity level will be higher than that in unvaccinated males .
therefore , the symptoms and the duration of fever may be less severe in these patients than the symptoms of mumps orchitis in unvaccinated males .
the limited short - term follow - up period is the main limitation of this study .
long - term follow - up is needed to investigate the complications of mumps orchitis , such as testicular atrophy or subfertility . also , it is necessary to carry out more research involving comparisons with unvaccinated patients .
in addition , more effort should be directed toward determining the mechanism underlying the reemergence of mumps and mumps orchitis , and an additional booster vaccination should be developed .
as shown in our study , the clinical manifestations of mumps orchitis in postpubertal vaccinated patients include a relatively shorter febrile duration , less scrotal swelling , and a low incidence of bilateral orchitis compared with unvaccinated patients .
additional long - term follow - up and large prospective studies are needed to determine ways to prevent outbreaks of mumps and mumps orchitis , and an additional booster vaccination should be considered ."	" purposealthough the measles - mumps - rubella vaccination covers most children against mumps in korea , the development of mumps has been reported .

MATERIALS AND METHODS
RESULTS
DISCUSSION
CONCLUSIONS"
95	"during january 1june 30 , 2015 , a total of 562 suspected cases of meningitis and 51 deaths ( case - fatality ratio [ cfr ] 9.1% ) from this disease were reported in the national surveillance system in the dogondoutchi health district of niger ( estimated population 727,282 ) ( 2 ) .
mdecins sans frontires supported niger s ministry of public health in its epidemic response in dogondoutchi by providing patient care with 5 days of injectable ceftriaxone , as described in recent recommendations ( 3 ) ; reinforcing surveillance by providing training on case definitions ; collecting data ; and collaborating in reactive vaccination campaigns .
a patient - level database containing patient demographics , treatment , laboratory results , and outcome was maintained during january 2may 17 , 2015 ; during this period , the database compiled information for 473 case - patients . in september 2015 , in collaboration with the ministry of health , teams consisting of a community health worker and a nurse attempted home visits to each of the 473 case - patients ( or surviving family members ) in the database .
team members verified patients vital status and treatments received and assessed for presence of 6 major sequelae , offering treatment and referral when necessary .
paralysis and anosmia were noted on physical exam ( anosmia was evaluated by asking participants to smell a pungent local food with their eyes closed ) .
persistent convulsions , hearing loss , loss of developmental milestones ( among children < 5 years of age ) , and persistent mental incapacity ( among persons > 5 years of age ) were subjectively reported by patients ( or family members ) . during the home visit
, teams used a standardized questionnaire to collect information and conduct a household census ( table ) .
team members asked whether meningitis had been diagnosed in other family members during the epidemic and verified reported diagnoses by written records available from the patient or by verbal confirmation of the number of doses of intramuscular ceftriaxone received .
a meningitis death was considered to be any death occurring < 30 days of symptom onset . * data missing for 3 patients .
the original patient database was anonymized during analysis , and no identifying information was collected .
niger s ministry of public health approved the overall intervention , including the home visits conducted after the epidemic .
of the 473 meningitis patients in the database , 369 ( 78.0% ) could be visited at home . in the original patient database ,
6 patients that were reported as dead in the database were found to be alive ; 22 patients reported as recovered had in fact died , for a total of 70 meningitis deaths ( cfr 14.8% ) .
collection of biologic samples for confirmation was emphasized during the epidemic ; consequently , 406 ( 82.5% ) of the 473 reported patients received a lumbar puncture , and 252 ( 63.6% ) patient samples were positive for n. meningitidis , streptococcus pneumoniae , or haemophilus influenzae type b infection by pcr performed at the national reference laboratory for meningitis in niamey . among the positive samples , 189 ( 75.0% ) were n. meningitidis serotype c ; 47 ( 18.7% ) were n. meningitidis serotype w ; 13 ( 5.2% ) were s. pneumoniae ; and 3 ( 1.2% ) were n. meningitidis serogroup unspecified .   of the 189 patients with confirmed n. meningitidis serogroup c infection , 23 died ( cfr 12.2% ) . a difference in death rates by sex was not statistically significant : 12 ( 9.8% ) of 123 male patients died , compared with 11 ( 16.7% ) of 66 female patients ( p = 0.16 by  test ) .
no difference appeared between recorded clinical signs and symptoms ( i.e. , headache , fever , neck stiffness , convulsions , vomiting , irritability , altered consciousness , bulging fontanelles , and focal neurologic symptoms ) for patients with confirmed n. meningitidis serotype c infection and those for patients with all other suspected infections . during the follow - up home visits ,
the rate of sequelae among patients with confirmed n. meningitidis serogroup c infection was 15.1% ( 19/126 ) , compared with 7.7% ( 3/39 ) for patients with all other confirmed infections and 7.9% ( 11/140 ) for all other patients ( i.e. , with suspected but unconfirmed cases or with suspected cases with negative test results ) ( p = 0.06 ) .
the 2 most common reported sequelae among patients with confirmed infections were hearing loss ( 15/126 [ 11.9% ] ) and persistent mental incapacity or loss of milestones ( 4/126 [ 3.2% ] ) .
patients with these sequelae did not differ in sex or age from other patients .  
the 369 case - patients ( or their surviving family members ) who received home visits after the epidemic lived in 346 households . for 298 households ,
only 1 case occurred ; 48 ( 13.0% ) households had multiple case - patients . among these 48 households ,
however , the home interviews revealed 26 households with additional case - patients ( i.e. , who confirmed receiving multiple doses of ceftriaxone ) not found in the patient database .
taking into account the household census , the attack rate for subsequent case - patients in a household after notification of a first case was 1,760/100,000 population . during the same period , in the dogondoutchi health district , the overall attack rate was 79/100,000 population .
median time between onset of the first case in a household and a subsequent case was 3 days ( interquartile range 18 ) .
by collecting detailed information on individual notified cases and then making home visits to 80% of case - patients 4 months after the epidemic ended , we gathered insights into this novel strain of n. meningitidis serogroup c. the cfr in the dogondoutchi district was higher than the country s average and was also higher among women . although slightly higher than cfrs seen in past n. meningitidis serogroup a epidemics , deaths recorded in the surveillance system were mostly in line with those occurring in historic epidemics .
the prevalence of sequelae in confirmed cases of n. meningitidis serogroup c also falls in line with descriptions of sequelae caused by other meningococcus serotypes ( 4 ) .
overall , the characteristics of this epidemic are similar to those of historic epidemics of n. meningitidis before the introduction of menafrivac ( 46 ) .
home visits enabled quantification of attack rates among members of households reporting a meningitis case .
because of the short time between the first and subsequent cases , subsequent cases should not be considered secondary cases , although household members are at higher risk for infection compared with the community at large .
this finding could eventually support the use of antimicrobial drug prophylaxis for household members of meningitis patients , although more research on this topic is warranted .
given the heterogeneous distribution of cases across districts in other epidemics ( 7 ) , subdistrict - level analyses would be preferable to district - level analyses .
finally , even with dedicated resources to reinforce surveillance during the epidemic , we found unreported cases during the home visits and , after confirmation of patients vital status , the case - fatality ratio differed from that reported .

Conclusions"
97	"the hemodynamic effects of pericardial fluid accumulation are the result of increased intrapericardial pressure , leading to impaired diastolic filling and a low cardiac stroke volume , which is potentially life - threatening .
it is known that non - small cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) patients harboring epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) mutations are responsive to egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( egfr - tkis ) such as gefitinib and erlotinib [ 1 , 2 ] .
egfr - tkis have been found to have a significant impact in nsclc patients with egfr mutations [ 13 ] .
several prospective trials have shown the tumor response rates to gefitinib therapy to be approximately 75% in patients with tumors harboring egfr mutations [ 46 ] . however , despite the initial dramatic tumor shrinkage , the tumors of most patients subsequently become resistant to egfr - tkis and eventually relapse .
we herein report the case of a patient with recurrence - related carcinomatous pericarditis arising from a secondary resistant mutation , t790 m , that could be detected in the pericardial effusion .
a 75-year - old japanese male was admitted to our hospital complaining of lumbago , which had persisted for one month .
he was an ex - smoker , and had type ii diabetes , hypertension and ileus .
chest computed tomography ( ct ) revealed a 37-mm diameter mass lesion in the left lower lobe of his lung .
we diagnosed the patient to have lung cancer with multiple bone metastases , brain metastasis , and liver metastasis ( ct2an0m1b , stage iv ) .
after the patient provided informed consent , we analyzed the specimen obtained from the tblb for egfr mutations .
the patient was treated with cisplatin and pemetrexed as a first - line chemotherapy ; however , after one cycle of the treatment , he developed paralysis of his left leg , and this symptom was rapidly progressive . therefore , an emergency operation was performed for posterior lumbar interbody fusion . as second - line chemotherapy ,
one month later , the size of both the primary lesion and the bone metastases were found to have decreased .
three months later , he developed dyspnea at rest and edema . furthermore , he had severe dyspnea and orthopnea , with a resting heart rate of 160170 beats / min and a blood pressure of 63/43 mm hg .
his temperature was 36.8c , and his arterial oxygen saturation was 88.0% on room air . a physical examination revealed distant heart sounds and a significantly distended internal jugular vein to the jaw level .
chest radiographs showed cardiomegaly with an increased cardiothoracic ratio and bilateral pleural effusion ( fig .
2a ) . a ct scan of the chest revealed a large pericardial effusion ( fig . 2b ) .
an emergency echocardiogram confirmed the presence of a large pericardial effusion , together with evidence of diastolic collapse of the right artrium , ventricle and left atrium , consistent with cardiac tamponade ( fig . 2c ) .
the patient underwent pericardiocentesis of 520 ml of malignant sanguineous fluid , and placement of a pericardial drain , while having removed 1,100 ml of sanguineous fluid , in which adenocarcinoma was detected ( fig .
egfr mutation analysis was performed in this pericardial effusion , and both the 18-base pair deletion in exon 19 and a second mutation , t790 m in exon 20 , were detected ( fig .
the patient temporarily recovered from the state of shock and survived for one month after drainage .
one is that the recurrence manifested as cardiac tamponade due to the presence of malignant pericardial effusion of nsclc after erlotinib therapy . in a large retrospective analysis of autopsies with
confirmed primary malignancies , metastases to the heart and pericardium were present in 10% of patients .
lung cancer is the most frequent cause of malignant pericardial effusion , accounting for approximately 4774% of cases , and adenocardinoma was the most frequent histological type associated with the condition . on the other hand , only approximately 2.5% of lung cancer patients
develop carcinomatous pericarditis . in this case , the patient had an egfr mutation with an 18-base pair deletion , and initially had a good response to treatment with an egfr - tki .
the central nervous system is a frequent site of disease recurrence in patients with nsclc after an initial response to egfr - tkis .
however , cardiac tamponade due to carcinomatous pericarditis as the recurrence site has not been reported previously for patients treated with egfr - tkis such as gefitinib or erlotinib .
therefore , we consider that we have herein reported an extremely rare case of an unusual metastatic recurrence site .
the mechanism of metastasis to the heart , like that to other organs , can be by direct contiguous growth , hematogeneous dissemination , or vascular growth along the vena cava , pulmonary veins , or lympatic channels .
the pericardial fluid collection is thought to result from the lymphatic obstruction of fluid from the pericardial sac . in this case
, it was thought to be caused by hematogeneous dissemination , since a chest ct scan showed no mediastinal lymph node invasion .
one of the most interesting findings of this case was the fact that the pericardial effusion acted as a surrogate tissue .
dna in pleural effusion fluid and cerebrospinal fluid , as well as serum dna , can be used to detect egfr mutations , and it has been known that these samples can show evidence of egfr mutations [ 1214 ] . however , it was unknown whether other samples , including pericardial effusion , could be useful for detecting egfr mutations . to our knowledge , this is the first report to detect the resistant mutation t790 m in pericardial effusion .
cardiac tamponade caused by carcinomatous pericarditis is a potentially life - threatening complication , and is a medical emergency caused by fluid accumulation around the cardiac chambers that influence cardiac output .
therefore , it is very difficult to obtain a sufficient tumor sample by a transbronchial tumor biopsy in such a case .
we suggest that the egfr mutation status in the pericardial effusion may therefore be useful as a predictor of the response to egfr - tkis for the patients with pericardial tamponade as the first manifestation .
further validation with a large number of cases will be needed to confirm that the detection of egfr mutations in pericardial effusion can be used to predict the response of the cancer to treatment ."	" we report the case of a japanese male with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( egfr - tki)-sensitive lung adenocarcinoma , who had an egfr mutation and presented in the emergency department with acute cardiac tamponade as the recurrence during egfr - tki therapy . 
 we could detect a second mutation , t790 m in exon 20 in the pericardial effusion . 
 this is the first report to detect the resistant mutation t790 m in pericardial effusion . 
 we suggest that the pericardial effusion may therefore be useful as surrogate tissue for detecting egfr mutation . "	"Introduction

99	"duplications of the alimentary tract are well - known but rare congenital malformations that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal ( gi ) tract from the tongue to the anus . while midgut duplications are the most common , foregut duplications such as oesophagus , stomach , and parts 1 and 2 of the duodenum account for approximately one - third of cases .
they are most commonly seen either in the thorax or abdomen or in both as congenital thoracoabdominal duplications .
cystic oesophageal duplication ( ced ) , the most common presentation , is often found in the lower third part ( 60 - 95% ) and on the right side [ 2 , 3 ] . hydatid cyst ( hc ) is still an important health problem throughout the world , particularly in latin america , africa , and mediterranean areas .
turkey , located in the mediterranean area , shares this problem , with an estimated incidence of 20/100 000 .
most commonly reported effected organ is liver , but in children the lungs are the second most frequent site of involvement [ 4 , 5 ] . in both ced and hc , the presentation depends on the site and the size of the cyst .
hydatid cysts are far more common than other cystic intrathoracic lesions , especially in endemic areas , so it is a challenge to differentiate ced from hc in these countries . here ,
we present a 7-year - old girl with intrathoracic cystic mass lesion , who had been treated for hydatid cyst for 9 months , but who turned out to have oesophageal cystic duplication .
a 7-year - old girl was referred to our clinic with coincidentally established cystic intrathoracic lesion during the investigation of aetiology of anaemia .
the child was first admitted with loss of vision in another hospital ten months previously .
the patient 's complaints had been attributed to pseudotumour cerebri due to severe iron deficiency anaemia ( haemoglobin : 3 g / dl ) .
chest radiography and computed tomography ( ct ) images resulted in a diagnosis of cystic intrathoracic lesion ( fig .
the cystic mass was accepted as a type 1 hydatid cyst according to world health organization ( who ) classification .
after 9 months of medication , no regression was detected in ct images , so the patient was referred to our department .
an ondirect haemagglutination test result was again negative . during surgery , after left thoracotomy incision , a semi - mobile cystic lesion , which was almost seven centimetres in diameter , with smooth contour , was found above the diaphragm , below the lung , outside the pleura ( fig .
the entire fluid in the cyst was aspirated ; it was brown and bloody ( fig .
2 ) . the diagnosis of cystic oesophageal duplication was considered , and so an attachment point was searched for .
it was below the hiatus , on the lower third left side of the oesophagus , and it also was excised completely through the hiatus .
pathologic analysis of the specimen showed oesophageal mucosa with an underlying proper smooth muscle layer .
computed tomography image of the cystic intrathoracic lesion cystic lesion with brownish fluid in the cyst
compressible organs facilitate the growth of the cyst , and this has been proposed as a reason for the apparent prevalence of lung involvement in children . diagnosis is often incidental and can be made with serological tests and imaging [ 5 , 7 ] .
laboratory investigations include the casoni and weinberg skin tests , indirect haemagglutination test , elisa , and the presence of eosinophilia , but can be falsely negative because children may have a poor serological response to eg .
false - positive reactions are related to the antigenic commonality among cestodes and conversely seronegativity can not exclude hydatidosis .
false - negative results are observed when cysts are calcified , even if fertile [ 4 , 8 ] . in our patient iha levels were negative twice .
due to the relatively non - specific clinical signs , diagnosis can only be made confidently using appropriate imaging .
plain radiographs , ultrasonography ( us ) , or ct scans are sufficient for diagnosis , but magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is also very useful [ 5 , 9 ] .
computed tomography demonstrates cyst wall calcification , infection , peritoneal seeding , bone involvement fluid density of intact cysts , and the characteristic internal structure of both uncomplicated and ruptured cysts [ 5 , 9 ] .
the conventional treatment of hydatid cysts in all organs is surgical . in children , small hydatid cysts of the lungs
respond favourably to medical treatment with oral administration of certain antihelminthic drugs such as albendazole in certain selected patients .
the response to therapy differs according to age , cyst size , cyst structure ( presence of daughter cysts inside the mother cysts and thickness of the pericystic capsule allowing penetration of the drugs ) , and localization of the cyst . in children , small cysts with thin pericystic capsule localised in the brain and lungs respond favourably [ 6 , 11 ] .
respiratory symptoms are seen predominantly in cases before two years of age . in our patient , who has vision loss , the asymptomatic duplication cyst was found incidentally .
the lesion occupied the left hemithorax although the most common localisation reported in the literature is the lower and right oesophagus .
the presentation depends on the site and the size of the malformations , varying from dysphagia and respiratory distress to a lump and perforation or bleeding into the intestine , but cysts are mostly diagnosed incidentally .
if a cystic mass is suspected in the chest , the best technique for evaluation is ct .
magnetic resonance imaging can be used to detail the intimate nature of the cyst with the spinal canal .
duplications should have all three typical signs : first of all , they should be attached to at least one point of the alimentary tract ; second and third are that they should have a well - developed smooth muscle coat , and the epithelial lining of duplication should represent some portions of alimentary tract , respectively [ 2 , 10 , 12 ] . in summary , the cystic appearance of both can cause a misdiagnosis very easily due to the rarity of cystic oesophageal duplications as well as the higher incidence of hydatid cyst , especially in endemic areas ."	" the cystic appearance of both oesophageal duplications and pulmonary hydatid cysts can cause a misdiagnosis very easily due to rarity of cystic oesophageal duplications beside the higher incidence of hydatid cyst , especially in endemic areas . here 
 we report a 7-year - old girl with an oesophageal duplication cyst on the left side misdiagnosed as a hydatid cyst . 
 the aim of the study is to report rare oesophageal duplications in the differential diagnosis of intrathoracic cysts . "	"Introduction
