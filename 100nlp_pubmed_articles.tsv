0	36085896	Using Natural Language Processing of Clinical Notes to Predict Outcomes of Opioid Treatment Program.	Potential of natural language processing (NLP) in extracting patient's information from clinical notes of opioid treatment programs (OTP) and leveraging it in development of predictive models has not been fully explored. The goal of this study was to assess potential of NLP in identifying legal, social, mental, medical and family environment-based determinants of distress from clinical narratives of patients with opioid addiction, and then using this information in predicting OTP outcomes. Around 63% of patients reported improvements after completing OTP. We compared the results of logistics regression and random forest for predictive modeling. Random forest model performed slightly better than logistic regression (75% F1 score) with 74% accuracy. Clinical Relevance- Psychiatric and medical disorders, social, legal and family-based distress are important determinants of distress in patients enrolled in OTP. These information are often recorded in clinical notes. Extraction of this information and their utilization as features in machine learning models will lead to the enhancement of the performance of the OTP outcome predictive models.	2022	Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
1	36085766	A streamable large-scale clinical EEG dataset for Deep Learning.	Deep Learning has revolutionized various fields, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, as well as Biomedical research. Within the field of neuroscience, specifically in electrophysiological neuroimaging, researchers are starting to explore leveraging deep learning to make predictions on their data without extensive feature engineering. The availability of large-scale datasets is a crucial aspect of allowing the experimentation of Deep Learning models. We are publishing the first large-scale clinical EEG dataset that simplifies data access and management for Deep Learning. This dataset contains eyes-closed EEG data prepared from a collection of 1,574 juvenile participants from the Healthy Brain Network. We demonstrate a use case integrating this framework, and discuss why providing such neuroinformatics infrastructure to the community is critical for future scientific discoveries.	2022	Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc
2	36076301	Review of techniques and models used in optical chemical structure recognition in images and scanned documents.	Extraction of chemical formulas from images was not in the top priority of Computer Vision tasks for a while. The complexity both on the input and prediction sides has made this task challenging for the conventional Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning problems. A binary input image which might seem trivial for convolutional analysis was not easy to classify, since the provided sample was not representative of the given molecule: to describe the same formula, a variety of graphical representations which do not resemble each other can be used. Considering the variety of molecules, the problem shifted from classification to that of formula generation, which makes Natural Language Processing (NLP) a good candidate for an effective solution. This paper describes the evolution of approaches from rule-based structure analyses to complex statistical models, and compares the efficiency of models and methodologies used in the recent years. Although the latest achievements deliver ideal results on particular datasets, the authors mention possible problems for various scenarios and provide suggestions for further development.	2022	J Cheminform
3	36076111	Home language and literacy environment and its relationship to socioeconomic status and white matter structure in infancy.	The home language and literacy environment (HLLE) in infancy has been associated with subsequent pre-literacy skill development and HLLE at preschool-age has been shown to correlate with white matter organization in tracts that subserve pre-reading and reading skills. Furthermore, childhood socioeconomic status (SES) has been linked with both HLLE and white matter organization. It is important to understand whether the relationships between environmental factors such as HLLE and SES and white matter organization can be detected as early as infancy, as this period is characterized by rapid brain development that may make white matter pathways particularly susceptible to these early experiences. Here, we hypothesized that HLLE (1) relates to white matter organization in pre-reading and reading-related tracts in infants, and (2) mediates a link between SES and white matter organization. To test these hypotheses, infants (mean age: 8.6 ± 2.3 months, N = 38) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging MRI during natural sleep. Image processing was performed with an infant-specific pipeline and fractional anisotropy (FA) was estimated from the arcuate fasciculus (AF) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) bilaterally using the baby automated fiber quantification method. HLLE was measured with the Reading subscale of the StimQ (StimQ-Reading) and SES was measured with years of maternal education. Self-reported maternal reading ability was also quantified and applied to our statistical models as a proxy for confounding genetic effects. StimQ-Reading positively correlated with FA in left AF and to maternal education, but did not mediate the relationship between them. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of considering HLLE from the start of life and may inform novel prevention and intervention strategies to support developing infants during a period of heightened brain plasticity.	2022	Brain Struct Funct
4	36085232	Machine-learning as a validated tool to characterize individual differences in free recall of naturalistic events.	The use of naturalistic stimuli, such as narrative movies, is gaining popularity in many fields, characterizing memory, affect, and decision-making. Narrative recall paradigms are often used to capture the complexity and richness of memory for naturalistic events. However, scoring narrative recalls is time-consuming and prone to human biases. Here, we show the validity and reliability of using a natural language processing tool, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), to automatically score narrative recalls. We compared the reliability in scoring made between two independent raters (i.e., hand scored) and between our automated algorithm and individual raters (i.e., automated) on trial-unique video clips of magic tricks. Study 1 showed that our automated segmentation approaches yielded high reliability and reflected measures yielded by hand scoring. Study 1 further showed that the results using USE outperformed another popular natural language processing tool, GloVe. In Study 2, we tested whether our automated approach remained valid when testing individuals varying on clinically relevant dimensions that influence episodic memory, age, and anxiety. We found that our automated approach was equally reliable across both age groups and anxiety groups, which shows the efficacy of our approach to assess narrative recall in large-scale individual difference analysis. In sum, these findings suggested that machine learning approach implementing USE is a promising tool for scoring large-scale narrative recalls and perform individual difference analysis for research using naturalistic stimuli.	2022	Psychon Bull Rev
5	36084069	Towards gender-inclusive job postings: A data-driven comparison of augmented writing technologies.	Job advertisements are often worded in ways that might pose discrimination risks leading to the exclusion of certain groups of applicants, particularly in relation to their gender. Especially in male-dominated professions or leadership roles, the specific linguistic formulation of job postings acquires relevance if more women are to be attracted to apply. Various technologies have emerged that offer automated text screening, some of them even suggesting alternative formulations to increase gender inclusivity. In this study we analyze four software providers on the German market using a corpus of ∼160, 000 job ads from three different platforms. We identify the relevant social psychological research on gender and language that is at the scientific core of these technologies. We show that, despite sharing a common foundation, the four tools assess the potential for exclusion in job postings in a considerably divergent way on multiple levels of comparison. We discuss the levers in the software pipeline of all four technologies, as well as the potential effect of certain implementation decisions, such as string-based vs. semantic approaches to computational processing of natural language. We argue that the 'technological translation' of research is extremely involved and further studies of its use in practice are needed to assess the potential for more gender equality.	2022	PLoS One
6	36084041	AFR-BERT: Attention-based mechanism feature relevance fusion multimodal sentiment analysis model.	Multimodal sentiment analysis is an essential task in natural language processing which refers to the fact that machines can analyze and recognize emotions through logical reasoning and mathematical operations after learning multimodal emotional features. For the problem of how to consider the effective fusion of multimodal data and the relevance of multimodal data in multimodal sentiment analysis, we propose an attention-based mechanism feature relevance fusion multimodal sentiment analysis model (AFR-BERT). In the data pre-processing stage, text features are extracted using the pre-trained language model BERT (Bi-directional Encoder Representation from Transformers), and the BiLSTM (Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory) is used to obtain the internal information of the audio. In the data fusion phase, the multimodal data fusion network effectively fuses multimodal features through the interaction of text and audio information. During the data analysis phase, the multimodal data association network analyzes the data by exploring the correlation of fused information between text and audio. In the data output phase, the model outputs the results of multimodal sentiment analysis. We conducted extensive comparative experiments on the publicly available sentiment analysis datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI. The experimental results show that AFR-BERT improves on the classical multimodal sentiment analysis model in terms of relevant performance metrics. In addition, ablation experiments and example analysis show that the multimodal data analysis network in AFR-BERT can effectively capture and analyze the sentiment features in text and audio.	2022	PLoS One
7	36083212	A survey of automated methods for biomedical text simplification.	"OBJECTIVE: Plain language in medicine has long been advocated as a way to improve patient understanding and engagement. As the field of Natural Language Processing has progressed, increasingly sophisticated methods have been explored for the automatic simplification of existing biomedical text for consumers. We survey the literature in this area with the goals of characterizing approaches and applications, summarizing existing resources, and identifying remaining challenges.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We search English language literature using lists of synonyms for both the task (eg, ""text simplification"") and the domain (eg, ""biomedical""), and searching for all pairs of these synonyms using Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, PubMed, ACL Anthology, and DBLP. We expand search terms based on results and further include any pertinent papers not in the search results but cited by those that are.
RESULTS: We find 45 papers that we deem relevant to the automatic simplification of biomedical text, with data spanning 7 natural languages. Of these (nonexclusively), 32 describe tools or methods, 13 present data sets or resources, and 9 describe impacts on human comprehension. Of the tools or methods, 22 are chiefly procedural and 10 are chiefly neural.
CONCLUSIONS: Though neural methods hold promise for this task, scarcity of parallel data has led to continued development of procedural methods. Various low-resource mitigations have been proposed to advance neural methods, including paragraph-level and unsupervised models and augmentation of neural models with procedural elements drawing from knowledge bases. However, high-quality parallel data will likely be crucial for developing fully automated biomedical text simplification."	2022	J Am Med Inform Assoc
8	36082176	Index diagnoses of gastric intestinal metaplasia in the United States: patient characteristics, endoscopic findings, and clinical practice patterns at a large tertiary care center.	"Background: Gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) is a premalignant gastric mucosal change that is often incidentally detected during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Despite the established higher risk of gastric cancer associated with GIM, the incidence, prevalence, and outcomes data for GIM are limited in the United States (US), and practice patterns are highly variable.
Objectives: Our primary objectives were to accurately identify incident histology-confirmed GIM cases and determine patient characteristics, endoscopy findings, 
Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data.
Methods: We first developed and validated a rule-based natural language processing tool to identify the patients with GIM on gastrointestinal pathology reports between 2011 and 2016. We then performed a manual chart review of all EGD procedures and associated pathology notes to confirm cases and obtain clinically relevant data.
Results: In all, 414 patients with an index diagnosis of GIM were confirmed (prevalence = 2.5% of patients undergoing any EGD). A majority (52.4%) of patients were non-Hispanic white. The most common indication for EGD was abdominal pain (46.9%). A majority (55%) did not receive specific follow-up recommendations or were asked to see their primary care provider. HP testing was documented in 86% of patients, and detected in 94 patients (prevalence = 26.4%). Treatment was documented in 94.7% of cases, and eradication confirmed in only 34.8% of these cases.
Conclusion: A large group of US patients with an index diagnosis of GIM was accurately identified. There was wide variability in clinical practice patterns including biopsy practice, HP treatment and eradication confirmation testing, and surveillance recommendations. This work demonstrates that there is a major unmet need for quality improvement efforts to standardize care for patients with GIM, a premalignant condition, and inform future prospective studies in a US population."	2022	Therap Adv Gastroenterol
9	36080906	Cross-Language Speech Emotion Recognition Using Bag-of-Word Representations, Domain Adaptation, and Data Augmentation.	"To date, several methods have been explored for the challenging task of cross-language speech emotion recognition, including the bag-of-words (BoW) methodology for feature processing, domain adaptation for feature distribution ""normalization"", and data augmentation to make machine learning algorithms more robust across testing conditions. Their combined use, however, has yet to be explored. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and compare the benefits achieved by combining different domain adaptation strategies with the BoW method, as well as with data augmentation. Moreover, while domain adaptation strategies, such as the correlation alignment (CORAL) method, require knowledge of the test data language, we propose a variant that we term N-CORAL, in which test languages (in our case, Chinese) are mapped to a common distribution in an unsupervised manner. Experiments with German, French, and Hungarian language datasets were performed, and the proposed N-CORAL method, combined with BoW and data augmentation, was shown to achieve the best arousal and valence prediction accuracy, highlighting the usefulness of the proposed method for ""in the wild"" speech emotion recognition. In fact, N-CORAL combined with BoW was shown to provide robustness across languages, whereas data augmentation provided additional robustness against cross-corpus nuance factors."	2022	Sensors (Basel)
10	36080901	Thought on Food: A Systematic Review of Current Approaches and Challenges for Food Intake Detection.	Nowadays, individuals have very stressful lifestyles, affecting their nutritional habits. In the early stages of life, teenagers begin to exhibit bad habits and inadequate nutrition. Likewise, other people with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or other conditions may not take food or medicine regularly. Therefore, the ability to monitor could be beneficial for them and for the doctors that can analyze the patterns of eating habits and their correlation with overall health. Many sensors help accurately detect food intake episodes, including electrogastrography, cameras, microphones, and inertial sensors. Accurate detection may provide better control to enable healthy nutrition habits. This paper presents a systematic review of the use of technology for food intake detection, focusing on the different sensors and methodologies used. The search was performed with a Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework that helps screen irrelevant studies while following the PRISMA methodology. It automatically searched and filtered the research studies in different databases, including PubMed, Springer, ACM, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, and Elsevier. Then, the manual analysis selected 30 papers based on the results of the framework for further analysis, which support the interest in using sensors for food intake detection and nutrition assessment. The mainly used sensors are cameras, inertial, and acoustic sensors that handle the recognition of food intake episodes with artificial intelligence techniques. This research identifies the most used sensors and data processing methodologies to detect food intake.	2022	Sensors (Basel)
11	36080852	Compression of Text in Selected Languages-Efficiency, Volume, and Time Comparison.	The goal of the research was to study the possibility of using the planned language Esperanto for text compression, and to compare the results of the text compression in Esperanto with the compression in natural languages, represented by Polish and English. The authors performed text compression in the created program in Python using four compression algorithms: zlib, lzma, bz2, and zl4 in four versions of the text: in Polish, English, Esperanto, and Esperanto in x notation (without characters outside ASCII encoding). After creating the compression program, and compressing the proper texts, authors conducted an analysis on the comparison of compression time and the volume of the text before and after compression. The results of the study confirmed the hypothesis, based on which the planned language, Esperanto, gives better text compression results than the natural languages represented by Polish and English. The confirmation by scientific methods that Esperanto is more optimal for text compression is the scientific added value of the paper.	2022	Sensors (Basel)
12	36074543	Understanding Gender Biases and Differences in Web-Based Reviews of Sanctioned Physicians Through a Machine Learning Approach: Mixed Methods Study.	"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have highlighted gender differences in web-based physician reviews; however, so far, no study has linked web-based ratings with quality of care.
OBJECTIVE: We compared a consumer-generated measure of physician quality (web-based ratings) with a clinical quality outcome (sanctions for malpractice or improper behavior) to understand how patients' perceptions and evaluations of physicians differ based on the physician's gender.
METHODS: We used data from a large web-based physician review website and the Federation of State Medical Boards. We implemented paragraph vector methods to identify words that are specific to and indicative of separate groups of physicians. Then, we enriched these findings by using the National Research Council Canada word-emotion association lexicon to assign emotional scores to reviews for different subpopulations according to gender, gender and sanction, and gender and rating.
RESULTS: We found statistically significant differences in the sentiment and emotion of reviews between male and female physicians. Numerical ratings are lower and sentiment in text reviews is more negative for women who will be sanctioned than for men who will be sanctioned; sanctioned male physicians are still associated with positive reviews.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the growing impact of web-based reviews on demand for physician services, understanding the different dynamics of reviews for male and female physicians is important for consumers and platform architects who may revisit their platform design."	2022	JMIR Form Res
13	36073490	GRASCCO - The First Publicly Shareable, Multiply-Alienated German Clinical Text Corpus.	We describe the creation of GRASCCO, a novel German-language corpus composed of some 60 clinical documents with more than.43,000 tokens. GRASCCO is a synthetic corpus resulting from a series of alienation steps to obfuscate privacy-sensitive information contained in real clinical documents, the true origin of all GRASCCO texts. Therefore, it is publicly shareable without any legal restrictions We also explore whether this corpus still represents common clinical language use by comparison with a real (non-shareable) clinical corpus we developed as a contribution to the Medical Informatics Initiative in Germany (MII) within the SMITH consortium. We find evidence that such a claim can indeed be made.	2022	Stud Health Technol Inform
14	36071325	A Clinical Reasoning-Encoded Case Library Developed through Natural Language Processing.	"IMPORTANCE: Case reports that externalize expert diagnostic reasoning are utilized for clinical reasoning instruction but are difficult to search based on symptoms, final diagnosis, or differential diagnosis construction. Computational approaches that uncover how experienced diagnosticians analyze the medical information in a case as they formulate a differential diagnosis can guide educational uses of case reports.
OBJECTIVE: To develop a ""reasoning-encoded"" case database for advanced clinical reasoning instruction by applying natural language processing (NLP), a sub-field of artificial intelligence, to a large case report library.
DESIGN: We collected 2525 cases from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Clinical Pathological Conference (CPC) from 1965 to 2020 and used NLP to analyze the medical terminology in each case to derive unbiased (not prespecified) categories of analysis used by the clinical discussant. We then analyzed and mapped the degree of category overlap between cases.
RESULTS: Our NLP algorithms identified clinically relevant categories that reflected the relationships between medical terms (which included symptoms, signs, test results, pathophysiology, and diagnoses). NLP extracted 43,291 symptoms across 2525 cases and physician-annotated 6532 diagnoses (both primary and related diagnoses). Our unsupervised learning computational approach identified 12 categories of medical terms that characterized the differential diagnosis discussions within individual cases. We used these categories to derive a measure of differential diagnosis similarity between cases and developed a website ( universeofcpc.com ) to allow visualization and exploration of 55 years of NEJM CPC case series.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying NLP to curated instances of diagnostic reasoning can provide insight into how expert clinicians correlate and coordinate disease categories and processes when creating a differential diagnosis. Our reasoning-encoded CPC case database can be used by clinician-educators to design a case-based curriculum and by physicians to direct their lifelong learning efforts."	2022	J Gen Intern Med
15	36071081	Improving ascertainment of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt with natural language processing.	Methods relying on diagnostic codes to identify suicidal ideation and suicide attempt in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) at scale are suboptimal because suicide-related outcomes are heavily under-coded. We propose to improve the ascertainment of suicidal outcomes using natural language processing (NLP). We developed information retrieval methodologies to search over 200 million notes from the Vanderbilt EHR. Suicide query terms were extracted using word2vec. A weakly supervised approach was designed to label cases of suicidal outcomes. The NLP validation of the top 200 retrieved patients showed high performance for suicidal ideation (area under the receiver operator curve [AUROC]: 98.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 97.1-99.5) and suicide attempt (AUROC: 97.3, 95% CI 95.2-98.7). Case extraction produced the best performance when combining NLP and diagnostic codes and when accounting for negated suicide expressions in notes. Overall, we demonstrated that scalable and accurate NLP methods can be developed to identify suicidal behavior in EHRs to enhance prevention efforts, predictive models, and precision medicine.	2022	Sci Rep
16	36070785	The Digital Analytic Patient Reviewer (DAPR) for COVID-19 Data Mart Validation.	"OBJECTIVE: To provide high-quality data for COVID-19 research, we validated derived COVID-19 clinical indicators and 22 associated machine learning phenotypes, in the Mass General Brigham (MGB) COVID-19 Data Mart.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen reviewers performed a retrospective manual chart review for 150 COVID-19 positive patients in the data mart. To support rapid chart review for a wide range of target data, we offered a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based chart review tool, the Digital Analytic Patient Reviewer (DAPR). For this work, we designed a dedicated patient summary view and developed new 127 NLP logics to extract COVID-19 relevant medical concepts and target phenotypes. Moreover, we transformed DAPR for research purposes, so that patient information is used for an approved research purpose only and enabled fast access to the integrated patient information. Lastly, we performed a survey to evaluate the validation difficulty and usefulness of the DAPR.
RESULTS: The concepts for COVID-19 positive cohort, COVID-19 index date, COVID-19 related admission, and the admission date were shown to have high values in all evaluation metrics. However, three phenotypes showed notable performance degradation than the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) in the pre-pandemic population. Based on these results, we removed the three phenotypes from our data mart. In the survey about using the tool, participants expressed positive attitudes towards using DAPR for chart review. They assessed the validation was easy and DAPR helped find relevant information. Some validation difficulties were also discussed.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Use of NLP technology in the chart review helped to cope with the challenges of the COVID-19 data validation task and accelerated the process. As a result, we could provide more reliable research data promptly and respond to the COVID-19 crisis. DAPR's benefit can be expanded to other domains. We plan to operationalize it for wider research groups."	2022	Methods Inf Med
17	36070624	A biomedical knowledge graph-based method for drug-drug interactions prediction through combining local and global features with deep neural networks.	Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) prediction is a challenging task in drug development and clinical application. Due to the extremely large complete set of all possible DDIs, computer-aided DDIs prediction methods are getting lots of attention in the pharmaceutical industry and academia. However, most existing computational methods only use single perspective information and few of them conduct the task based on the biomedical knowledge graph (BKG), which can provide more detailed and comprehensive drug lateral side information flow. To this end, a deep learning framework, namely DeepLGF, is proposed to fully exploit BKG fusing local-global information to improve the performance of DDIs prediction. More specifically, DeepLGF first obtains chemical local information on drug sequence semantics through a natural language processing algorithm. Then a model of BFGNN based on graph neural network is proposed to extract biological local information on drug through learning embedding vector from different biological functional spaces. The global feature information is extracted from the BKG by our knowledge graph embedding method. In DeepLGF, for fusing local-global features well, we designed four aggregating methods to explore the most suitable ones. Finally, the advanced fusing feature vectors are fed into deep neural network to train and predict. To evaluate the prediction performance of DeepLGF, we tested our method in three prediction tasks and compared it with state-of-the-art models. In addition, case studies of three cancer-related and COVID-19-related drugs further demonstrated DeepLGF's superior ability for potential DDIs prediction. The webserver of the DeepLGF predictor is freely available at http://120.77.11.78/DeepLGF/.	2022	Brief Bioinform
18	36069846	Discovering Long COVID Symptom Patterns: Association Rule Mining and Sentiment Analysis in Social Media Tweets.	"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is a substantial public health crisis that negatively affects human health and well-being. As a result of being infected with the coronavirus, patients can experience long-term health effects called long COVID syndrome. Multiple symptoms characterize this syndrome, and it is crucial to identify these symptoms as they may negatively impact patients' day-to-day lives. Breathlessness, fatigue, and brain fog are the 3 most common continuing and debilitating symptoms that patients with long COVID have reported, often months after the onset of COVID-19.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to understand the patterns and behavior of long COVID symptoms reported by patients on the Twitter social media platform, which is vital to improving our understanding of long COVID.
METHODS: Long COVID-related Twitter data were collected from May 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021. We used association rule mining techniques to identify frequent symptoms and establish relationships between symptoms among patients with long COVID in Twitter social media discussions. The highest confidence level-based detection was used to determine the most significant rules with 10% minimum confidence and 0.01% minimum support with a positive lift.
RESULTS: Among the 30,327 tweets included in our study, the most frequent symptoms were brain fog (n=7812, 25.8%), fatigue (n=5284, 17.4%), breathing/lung issues (n=4750, 15.7%), heart issues (n=2900, 9.6%), flu symptoms (n=2824, 9.3%), depression (n=2256, 7.4%) and general pains (n=1786, 5.9%). Loss of smell and taste, cold, cough, chest pain, fever, headache, and arm pain emerged in 1.6% (n=474) to 5.3% (n=1616) of patients with long COVID. Furthermore, the highest confidence level-based detection successfully demonstrates the potential of association analysis and the Apriori algorithm to establish patterns to explore 57 meaningful relationship rules among long COVID symptoms. The strongest relationship revealed that patients with lung/breathing problems and loss of taste are likely to have a loss of smell with 77% confidence.
CONCLUSIONS: There are very active social media discussions that could support the growing understanding of COVID-19 and its long-term impact. These discussions enable a potential field of research to analyze the behavior of long COVID syndrome. Exploratory data analysis using natural language processing methods revealed the symptoms and medical conditions related to long COVID discussions on the Twitter social media platform. Using Apriori algorithm-based association rules, we determined interesting and meaningful relationships between symptoms."	2022	JMIR Form Res
19	36069658	Neural Basis of the Implicit Learning of Complex Artificial Grammar with Nonadjacent Dependencies.	The capacity for the implicit learning/processing of complex grammar with nonadjacent dependencies is one of important features of human language learning. In this fMRI study, using an implicit AGL paradigm, we explored the neural basis of the implicit learning of the nonadjacent dependency rule, disentangling from sequence-based chunk knowledge (i.e., local sequential regularities or substring) by focusing on the low chunk strength items (which were naturally less similar to training strings), based on tracking neural responses during training and test phases. After listening to and memorizing a series of strings of 10 syllables generated from nonadjacent artificial grammar in the training phase, participants implicitly acquired the knowledge of grammar and chunks. Regarding grammaticality, Broca's area was specifically related to low chunk strength grammatical strings relative to nongrammatical strings in the test phase. This region showed decreased activity with time in the training phase, and a lesser decrease in activity was associated with higher performance in grammar learning. Furthermore, Broca's area showed significantly higher strength of functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus in the low chunk strength grammatical string compared with nongrammatical strings, and this functional connectivity increased with the training time. For the chunks, the performance of accurate discrimination of high chunk strength from low chunk strength nongrammatical strings was predicted by hippocampal activity in the training phase. Converging evidence from the training and test phases showed that Broca's area and its functional connectivity with the left superior temporal gyrus were engaged in the implicit learning/processing of the nonadjacent dependency rule, separating the effects of chunks.	2022	J Cogn Neurosci
20	36069653	Dissociation of Writing Processes: A Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study on the Neural Substrates for the Handwritten Production of Chinese Characters.	"Writing is an important way to communicate in everyday life because it can convey information over time and space, but its neural substrates remain poorly known. Although the neural basis of written language production has been investigated in alphabetic scripts, it has rarely been examined in nonalphabetic languages such as Chinese. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study explored the neural substrates of handwritten word production in Chinese and identified the brain regions sensitive to the psycholinguistic factors of word frequency and syllable frequency. To capture this, we contrasted neural activation in ""writing"" with ""speaking plus drawing"" and ""watching plus drawing."" Word frequency (high, low) and syllable frequency (high, low) of the picture names were manipulated. Contrasts between the tasks showed that writing Chinese characters was mainly associated with brain activation in the left frontal and parietal cortex, whereas orthographic processing and the motor procedures necessary for handwritten production were also related to activation in the right frontal and parietal cortex as well as right putamen/thalamus. These results demonstrate that writing Chinese characters requires activation in bilateral cortical regions and the right putamen/thalamus. Our results also revealed no brain activation associated with the main effects of word frequency and syllable frequency as well as their interaction, which implies that word frequency and syllable frequency may not affect the writing of Chinese characters on a neural level."	2022	J Cogn Neurosci
21	36068551	A comparative study of pre-trained language models for named entity recognition in clinical trial eligibility criteria from multiple corpora.	"BACKGROUND: Clinical trial protocols are the foundation for advancing medical sciences, however, the extraction of accurate and meaningful information from the original clinical trials is very challenging due to the complex and unstructured texts of such documents. Named entity recognition (NER) is a fundamental and necessary step to process and standardize the unstructured text in clinical trials using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
METHODS: In this study we fine-tuned pre-trained language models to support the NER task on clinical trial eligibility criteria. We systematically investigated four pre-trained contextual embedding models for the biomedical domain (i.e., BioBERT, BlueBERT, PubMedBERT, and SciBERT) and two models for the open domains (BERT and SpanBERT), for NER tasks using three existing clinical trial eligibility criteria corpora. In addition, we also investigated the feasibility of data augmentation approaches and evaluated their performance.
RESULTS: Our evaluation results using tenfold cross-validation show that domain-specific transformer models achieved better performance than the general transformer models, with the best performance obtained by the PubMedBERT model (F1-scores of 0.715, 0.836, and 0.622 for the three corpora respectively). The data augmentation results show that it is feasible to leverage additional corpora to improve NER performance.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study not only demonstrate the importance of contextual embeddings trained from domain-specific corpora, but also shed lights on the benefits of leveraging multiple data sources for the challenging NER task in clinical trial eligibility criteria text."	2022	BMC Med Inform Decis Mak
22	36068160	An Analysis of Diversity Statements and Support of Special Interest Societies by General Surgery Residency Programs.	"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the nondiscrimination and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) statements found on the websites of general surgery residency programs, as well as to measure programmatic commitment to diversity through their involvement with special interest surgical societies (SISS).
DESIGN: The authors evaluated the relationship between DEI statements and SISS participation, and performed a natural language processing analysis of general surgery residency DEI statements.
SETTING: The residency program websites from 319 non-military general surgery residency programs within the United States were analyzed.
PARTICIPANTS: This study evaluated the DEI statement and SISS participation in general surgery residency programs.
RESULTS: Of the 319 general surgery residency websites reviewed, 127 (39.8%) featured an identifiable statement of nondiscrimination or commitment to diversity. Compared to programs without diversity statements, programs with statements were more likely to be involved with special interest surgical societies (53.5% vs 30.7%, p < 0.001). Natural language processing analysis revealed that the diversity statements of programs with SISS involvement had higher word counts (p = 0.001), higher clout scores (measure of confidence conveyed, p = 0.001), and higher positive tone scores (p = 0.006) compared with the statements of those without special interest society involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: In the era of virtual interviewing, applicants are forced to rely heavily on surgery residency websites as their main source of information. Less than 40% of programs participating in the Match in 2022 feature diversity statements on their websites. Programs with some degree of involvement with special interest societies were more likely to have statements that score higher in confidence and positivity in natural language processing analysis, which may potentially reflect a more earnest commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. Residency programs should continue to improve the visibility of their DEI efforts to recruit a diverse resident class."	2022	J Surg Educ
23	36067870	Development and validation of a machine-learning algorithm to predict the relevance of scientific articles within the field of teratology.	The Dutch Teratology Information Service Lareb counsels healthcare professionals and patients about medication use during pregnancy and lactation. To keep the evidence up to date, employees perform a standardized weekly PubMed query where relevant literature is identified manually. We aimed to develop an accurate machine-learning algorithm to predict the relevance of PubMed entries, thereby reducing the labor-intensive task of manually screening the articles. We fine-tuned a pre-trained natural language processing transformer model to identify relevant entries. We split 15,540 labeled entries into case-control-balanced train, validation, and test datasets. Additionally, we externally validated the model prospectively with 1,288 labeled entries obtained from weekly queries after developing the model. This dataset was also independently labeled by a team of six experienced human raters to evaluate our model's performance. The validation of our machine learning model on the retrospectively collected outheld dataset obtained an area under the sensitivity-versus-specificity curve of 89.3% (CI: 88.2- 90.4). In the prospective external validation of the model, our model classified relevant literature with a sensitivity versus specificity curve area of 87.4% (CI: 85.0-89.8). Our model achieved a higher sensitivity than the human raters' team without sacrificing too much specificity. The team of human raters showed weak to moderate levels of agreement in their article classifications (kappa range 0.40-0.64). The human selection of the latest relevant literature is indispensable to keep the teratology information up to date. We show that automatic preselection of relevant abstracts using machine learning is possible without sacrificing the selection performance.	2022	Reprod Toxicol
24	36066938	Use of Social Media Data to Diagnose and Monitor Psychotic Disorders: Systematic Review.	"BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a disease associated with high burden, and improvement in care is necessary. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been used to diagnose several medical conditions as well as psychiatric disorders. However, this technology requires large amounts of data to be efficient. Social media data could be used to improve diagnostic capabilities.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study is to analyze the current capabilities of AI to use social media data as a diagnostic tool for psychotic disorders.
METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted using several databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, PsycInfo, and IEEE Xplore) using relevant keywords to search for articles published as of November 12, 2021. We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) criteria to identify, select, and critically assess the quality of the relevant studies while minimizing bias. We critically analyzed the methodology of the studies to detect any bias and presented the results.
RESULTS: Among the 93 studies identified, 7 studies were included for analyses. The included studies presented encouraging results. Social media data could be used in several ways to care for patients with schizophrenia, including the monitoring of patients after the first episode of psychosis. We identified several limitations in the included studies, mainly lack of access to clinical diagnostic data, small sample size, and heterogeneity in study quality. We recommend using state-of-the-art natural language processing neural networks, called language models, to model social media activity. Combined with the synthetic minority oversampling technique, language models can tackle the imbalanced data set limitation, which is a necessary constraint to train unbiased classifiers. Furthermore, language models can be easily adapted to the classification task with a procedure called ""fine-tuning.""
CONCLUSIONS: The use of social media data for the diagnosis of psychotic disorders is promising. However, most of the included studies had significant biases; we therefore could not draw conclusions about accuracy in clinical situations. Future studies need to use more accurate methodologies to obtain unbiased results."	2022	J Med Internet Res
25	36066930	Identification of Preterm Labor Evaluation Visits and Extraction of Cervical Length Measures from Electronic Health Records Within a Large Integrated Health Care System: Algorithm Development and Validation.	"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth (PTB) represents a significant public health problem in the United States and throughout the world. Accurate identification of preterm labor (PTL) evaluation visits is the first step in conducting PTB-related research.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a validated computerized algorithm to identify PTL evaluation visits and extract cervical length (CL) measures from electronic health records (EHRs) within a large integrated health care system.
METHODS: We used data extracted from the EHRs at Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2009 and 2020. First, we identified triage and hospital encounters with fetal fibronectin (fFN) tests, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) procedures, PTL medications, or PTL diagnosis codes within 24
RESULTS: A total of 441,673 live birth pregnancies were identified between 2009 and 2020. Of these, 103,139 pregnancies (23.35%) had documented PTL evaluation visits identified by the computerized algorithm. The trend of pregnancies with PTL evaluation visits slightly decreased from 24.41% (2009) to 17.42% (2020). Of the first 103,139 PTL visits, 19,439 (18.85%) and 44,423 (43.97%) had an fFN test and a TVUS, respectively. The percentage of first PTL visits with an fFN test decreased from 18.06% at 24
CONCLUSIONS: The developed computerized algorithm effectively identified PTL evaluation visits and extracted the corresponding CL measures from the EHRs. Validation against this algorithm achieved a high level of accuracy. This computerized algorithm can be used for conducting PTL- or PTB-related pharmacoepidemiologic studies and patient care reviews."	2022	JMIR Med Inform
26	36066439	Physical distance to sensory-motor landmarks predicts language function.	"Auditory language comprehension recruits cortical regions that are both close to sensory-motor landmarks (supporting auditory and motor features) and far from these landmarks (supporting word meaning). We investigated whether the responsiveness of these regions in task-based functional MRI is related to individual differences in their physical distance to primary sensorimotor landmarks. Parcels in the auditory network, that were equally responsive across story and math tasks, showed stronger activation in individuals who had less distance between these parcels and transverse temporal sulcus, in line with the predictions of the ""tethering hypothesis,"" which suggests that greater proximity to input regions might increase the fidelity of sensory processing. Conversely, language and default mode parcels, which were more active for the story task, showed positive correlations between individual differences in activation and sensory-motor distance from primary sensory-motor landmarks, consistent with the view that physical separation from sensory-motor inputs supports aspects of cognition that draw on semantic memory. These results demonstrate that distance from sensorimotor regions provides an organizing principle of functional differentiation within the cortex. The relationship between activation and geodesic distance to sensory-motor landmarks is in opposite directions for cortical regions that are proximal to the heteromodal (DMN and language network) and unimodal ends of the principal gradient of intrinsic connectivity."	2022	Cereb Cortex
27	36065351	Detecting non-natural language artifacts for de-noising bug reports.	Textual documents produced in the software engineering process are a popular target for natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) approaches. However, issue tickets often contain artifacts such as code snippets, log outputs and stack traces. These artifacts not only inflate the issue ticket sizes, but also can this noise constitute a real problem for some NLP approaches, and therefore has to be removed in the pre-processing of some approaches. In this paper, we present a machine learning based approach to classify textual content into natural language and non-natural language artifacts at line level. We show how data from GitHub issue trackers can be used for automated training set generation, and present a custom preprocessing approach for the task of artifact removal. The training sets are automatically created from Markdown annotated issue tickets and project documentation files. We use these generated training sets to train a Markdown agnostic model that is able to classify un-annotated content. We evaluate our approach on issue tickets from projects written in C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, and Python. Our approach achieves ROC-AUC scores between 0.92 and 0.96 for language-specific models. A multi-language model trained on the issue tickets of all languages achieves ROC-AUC scores between 0.92 and 0.95. The provided models are intended to be used as noise reduction pre-processing steps for NLP and IR approaches working on issue tickets.	2022	Autom Softw Eng

29	36061240	Artificial Intelligence and Inclusion: Formerly Gang-Involved Youth as Domain Experts for Analyzing Unstructured Twitter Data.	Mining social media data for studying the human condition has created new and unique challenges. When analyzing social media data from marginalized communities, algorithms lack the ability to accurately interpret off-line context, which may lead to dangerous assumptions about and implications for marginalized communities. To combat this challenge, we hired formerly gang-involved young people as domain experts for contextualizing social media data in order to create inclusive, community-informed algorithms. Utilizing data from the Gang Intervention and Computer Science Project-a comprehensive analysis of Twitter data from gang-involved youth in Chicago-we describe the process of involving formerly gang-involved young people in developing a new part-of-speech tagger and content classifier for a prototype natural language processing system that detects aggression and loss in Twitter data. We argue that involving young people as domain experts leads to more robust understandings of context, including localized language, culture, and events. These insights could change how data scientists approach the development of corpora and algorithms that affect people in marginalized communities and who to involve in that process. We offer a contextually driven interdisciplinary approach between social work and data science that integrates domain insights into the training of qualitative annotators and the production of algorithms for positive social impact.	2020	Soc Sci Comput Rev
30	36064471	Has COVID-19 changed carer's views of health and care integration in care homes? A sentiment difference-in-difference analysis of on-line service reviews.	Closer integration of health and social care is a policy priority in many countries. The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the necessity of joining up health and social care systems, especially in care home settings. However, the meaning and perceived importance of integration for residents' and carers' experience is unclear and we do not know whether it has changed during the pandemic. Using unique data from on-line care home service reviews, we combined multiple methods. We used Natural Language Processing with supervised machine learning to construct a measure of sentiment for care home residents' and their relatives' (measured by AFINN score). Difference-in-difference analysis was used to examine whether experiencing integrated care altered these sentiments by comparing changes in sentiment in reviews related to integration (containing specific terms) to those which were not. Finally, we used network analysis on post-estimation results to assess which specific attributes stakeholders focus on most when detailing their most/least positive experiences of health and care integration in care homes, and whether these attributes changed over the pandemic. Reviews containing integration words were more positive than reviews unrelated to integration in the pre-pandemic period (about 2.3 points on the AFINN score) and remained so during the first year of the pandemic. Overall positive sentiment increased during the COVID-19 period (average by +1.1 points), mainly in reviews mentioning integration terms at the beginning of the first (+2.17, p-value 0.175) and second waves (+3.678, p-value 0.027). The role of care home staff was pivotal in both positive and negative reviews, with a shift from aspects related to care in pre-pandemic to information services during the pandemic, signalling their importance in translating integrated needs-based paradigms into policy and practice.	2022	Health Policy

32	36063640	Auditory feedback control in adults who stutter during metronome-paced speech II. Formant Perturbation.	"PURPOSE: Prior work has shown that Adults who stutter (AWS) have reduced and delayed responses to auditory feedback perturbations. This study aimed to determine whether external timing cues, which increase fluency, resolve auditory feedback processing disruptions.
METHODS: Fifteen AWS and sixteen adults who do not stutter (ANS) read aloud a multisyllabic sentence either with natural stress and timing or with each syllable paced at the rate of a metronome. On random trials, an auditory feedback formant perturbation was applied, and formant responses were compared between groups and pacing conditions.
RESULTS: During normally paced speech, ANS showed a significant compensatory response to the perturbation by the end of the perturbed vowel, while AWS did not. In the metronome-paced condition, which significantly reduced the disfluency rate, the opposite was true: AWS showed a significant response by the end of the vowel, while ANS did not.
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate a potential link between the reduction in stuttering found during metronome-paced speech and changes in auditory motor integration in AWS."	2022	J Fluency Disord
33	36062781	Towards a universal definition of disease activity score thresholds: the AS135 score.	"OBJECTIVES: Many study groups have developed scores to reflect disease activity. The result of this fragmented process is a multitude of disease activity scores, even for a single disease. We aimed to identify and standardise disease activity scores in rheumatologyMETHODS: We conducted a literature review on disease activity criteria using both a manual approach and in-house computer software (BIBOT) that applies natural language processing to automatically identify and interpret important words in abstracts published in English between 1.1.1975 and 31.12.2018. We selected activity scores with cut-off values divided into four classes (remission and low, moderate and high disease activity). We used a linear interpolation to map disease activity scores to our new score, the AS135, and developed a smartphone application to perform the conversion.
RESULTS: A total of 108 activity criteria from various fields were identified, but it was in rheumatology that we found the most pronounced separation into four classes. We built the AS135 score modification for each selected score using a linear interpolation of the existing criteria. The score modification was defined on the interval [0,10], and values of 1, 3 and 5 were used as thresholds. These arbitrary thresholds were then associated with the thresholds of the existing criteria, and an interpolation was calculated, allowing conversion of the existing criteria into the AS135 criterion. Finally, we created a mobile application.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed an application for clinicians that enables the use of a single disease activity score for different inflammatory rheumatic diseases using an intuitive scale."	2022	Clin Exp Rheumatol

Internet public social media and forums provide a convenient channel for people concerned about public health issues, such as COVID-19, to share and discuss information/misinformation with each other. In this paper, we propose a natural language processing (NLP) method based on Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) technique to perform sentiment classification and uncover various issues related to COVID-19 public opinions. Bi-LSTM is an improved version of conventional LSTMs for generating the output from both left and right contexts at each time step. We experimented with real datasets extracted from Twitter and Reddit social media platforms, and our experimental results showed improved metrics compared with the conventional LSTM model as well as recent studies available in the literature. The proposed model can be used by official institutions to mitigate the effects of negative messages and to understand peoples' concerns during the pandemic. Furthermore, our findings shed light on the importance of using NLP techniques to analyze public opinion and to combat the spreading of misinformation and to guide health decision-making.	2023	Expert Syst Appl

Deep learning methods, such as reaction prediction and retrosynthesis analysis, have demonstrated their significance in the chemical field. However, the de novo generation of novel reactions using artificial intelligence technology requires further exploration. Inspired by molecular generation, we proposed a novel task of reaction generation. Herein, Heck reactions were applied to train the transformer model, a state-of-art natural language process model, to generate 4717 reactions after sampling and processing. Then, 2253 novel Heck reactions were confirmed by organizing chemists to judge the generated reactions. More importantly, further organic synthesis experiments were performed to verify the accuracy and feasibility of representative reactions. The total process, from Heck reaction generation to experimental verification, required only 15 days, demonstrating that our model has well-learned reaction rules in-depth and can contribute to novel reaction discovery and chemical space exploration.	2022	J Cheminform

40	36052318	Automatic rating of therapist facilitative interpersonal skills in text: A natural language processing application.	"Background: While message-based therapy has been shown to be effective in treating a range of mood disorders, it is critical to ensure that providers are meeting a consistently high standard of care over this medium. One recently developed measure of messaging quality-The Facilitative Interpersonal Skills Task for Text (FIS-T)-provides estimates of therapists' demonstrated ability to convey psychotherapy's common factors (e.g., hopefulness, warmth, persuasiveness) over text. However, the FIS-T's scoring procedure relies on trained human coders to manually code responses, thereby rendering the FIS-T an unscalable quality control tool for large messaging therapy platforms.
Objective: In the present study, researchers developed two algorithms to automatically score therapist performance on the FIS-T task.
Methods: The FIS-T was administered to 978 messaging therapists, whose responses were then manually scored by a trained team of raters. Two machine learning algorithms were then trained on task-taker messages and coder scores: a support vector regressor (SVR) and a transformer-based neural network (DistilBERT).
Results: The DistilBERT model had superior performance on the prediction task while providing a distribution of ratings that was more closely aligned with those of human raters, versus SVR. Specifically, the DistilBERT model was able to explain 58.8% of the variance (
Conclusions: Algorithms can be effectively used to ensure that digital providers meet a consistently high standard of interactions in the course of messaging therapy.

41	36052029	Text-Based Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning Approach.	Sentiment analysis is a method to identify people's attitudes, sentiments, and emotions towards a given goal, such as people, activities, organizations, services, subjects, and products. Emotion detection is a subset of sentiment analysis as it predicts the unique emotion rather than just stating positive, negative, or neutral. In recent times, many researchers have already worked on speech and facial expressions for emotion recognition. However, emotion detection in text is a tedious task as cues are missing, unlike in speech, such as tonal stress, facial expression, pitch, etc. To identify emotions from text, several methods have been proposed in the past using natural language processing (NLP) techniques: the keyword approach, the lexicon-based approach, and the machine learning approach. However, there were some limitations with keyword- and lexicon-based approaches as they focus on semantic relations. In this article, we have proposed a hybrid (machine learning + deep learning) model to identify emotions in text. Convolutional neural network (CNN) and Bi-GRU were exploited as deep learning techniques. Support vector machine is used as a machine learning approach. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated using a combination of three different types of datasets, namely, sentences, tweets, and dialogs, and it attains an accuracy of 80.11%.	2022	Comput Intell Neurosci

Monitoring drug safety is a central concern throughout the drug life cycle. Information about toxicity and adverse events is generated at every stage of this life cycle, and stakeholders have a strong interest in applying text mining and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to manage the ever-increasing volume of this information. Recognizing the importance of these applications and the role of challenge evaluations to drive progress in text mining, the organizers of BioCreative VII (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction in Biology) convened a panel of experts to explore 'Challenges in Mining Drug Adverse Reactions'. This article is an outgrowth of the panel; each panelist has highlighted specific text mining application(s), based on their research and their experiences in organizing text mining challenge evaluations. While these highlighted applications only sample the complexity of this problem space, they reveal both opportunities and challenges for text mining to aid in the complex process of drug discovery, testing, marketing and post-market surveillance. Stakeholders are eager to embrace natural language processing and AI tools to help in this process, provided that these tools can be demonstrated to add value to stakeholder workflows. This creates an opportunity for the BioCreative community to work in partnership with regulatory agencies, pharma and the text mining community to identify next steps for future challenge evaluations.	2022	Database (Oxford)
43	36050674	Automated extraction of information of lung cancer staging from unstructured reports of PET-CT interpretation: natural language processing with deep-learning.	"BACKGROUND: Extracting metastatic information from previous radiologic-text reports is important, however, laborious annotations have limited the usability of these texts. We developed a deep-learning model for extracting primary lung cancer sites and metastatic lymph nodes and distant metastasis information from PET-CT reports for determining lung cancer stages.
METHODS: PET-CT reports, fully written in English, were acquired from two cohorts of patients with lung cancer who were diagnosed at a tertiary hospital between January 2004 and March 2020. One cohort of 20,466 PET-CT reports was used for training and the validation set, and the other cohort of 4190 PET-CT reports was used for an additional-test set. A pre-processing model (Lung Cancer Spell Checker) was applied to correct the typographical errors, and pseudo-labelling was used for training the model. The deep-learning model was constructed using the Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network. The performance metrics for the prediction model were accuracy, precision, sensitivity, micro-AUROC, and AUPRC.
RESULTS: For the extraction of primary lung cancer location, the model showed a micro-AUROC of 0.913 and 0.946 in the validation set and the additional-test set, respectively. For metastatic lymph nodes, the model showed a sensitivity of 0.827 and a specificity of 0.960. In predicting distant metastasis, the model showed a micro-AUROC of 0.944 and 0.950 in the validation and the additional-test set, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our deep-learning method could be used for extracting lung cancer stage information from PET-CT reports and may facilitate lung cancer studies by alleviating laborious annotation by clinicians."	2022	BMC Med Inform Decis Mak
44	36049723	Natural Language Processing in Spine Surgery: A Systematic Review of Applications, Bias, and Reporting Transparency.	"BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) is a discipline of machine learning concerned with the analysis of language and text. Although NLP has been applied to various forms of clinical text, the applications and utility of NLP in spine surgery remain poorly characterized.
OBJECTIVE: Systematically review studies that use NLP for spine surgery applications and analyze applications, bias, and reporting transparency of the studies.
METHODS: We performed a literature search using the PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases. Data extraction was performed after appropriate screening. Risk of bias and reporting quality were assessed using the PROBAST and TRIPOD tools.
RESULTS: A total of 12 full-text articles were included. The most common diseases represented include spondylolisthesis (25%), scoliosis (17%), and lumbar disk herniation (17%). The most common procedures included spinal fusion (42%), imaging (e.g. MR, X-ray) (25%), and scoliosis correction (17%). Reported outcomes were diverse and included incidental durotomy, venous thromboembolism, and the tone of scoliosis surgery in social media posts. Common sources of bias identified included the use of older methods that do not capture the nuance of a text, and not using a pre-specified or standard outcome measure when evaluating NLP methods.
CONCLUSION: Although the application of NLP to spine surgery is expanding, current studies face limitations and none are indicated as ready for clinical use. Thus, for future studies we recommend an emphasis on transparent reporting and collaboration with NLP experts to incorporate the latest developments to improve models and contribute to further innovation."	2022	World Neurosurg
45	36049699	Neural correlates of multisensory enhancement in audiovisual narrative speech perception: A fMRI investigation.	This fMRI study investigated the effect of seeing articulatory movements of a speaker while listening to a naturalistic narrative stimulus. It had the goal to identify regions of the language network showing multisensory enhancement under synchronous audiovisual conditions. We expected this enhancement to emerge in regions known to underlie the integration of auditory and visual information such as the posterior superior temporal gyrus as well as parts of the broader language network, including the semantic system. To this end we presented 53 participants with a continuous narration of a story in auditory alone, visual alone, and both synchronous and asynchronous audiovisual speech conditions while recording brain activity using BOLD fMRI. We found multisensory enhancement in an extensive network of regions underlying multisensory integration and parts of the semantic network as well as extralinguistic regions not usually associated with multisensory integration, namely the primary visual cortex and the bilateral amygdala. Analysis also revealed involvement of thalamic brain regions along the visual and auditory pathways more commonly associated with early sensory processing. We conclude that under natural listening conditions, multisensory enhancement not only involves sites of multisensory integration but many regions of the wider semantic network and includes regions associated with extralinguistic sensory, perceptual and cognitive processing.	2022	Neuroimage

In early days, malaria-infected cells were diagnosed using a microscope. owing to a huge number of instances for analysis and intricacy of time, it may lead to false detection. Automated parasite detection technologies are in high demand due to increased time consumption and erroneous detection. To create effective cures and treatments, it is critical to use an accurate approach for predicting malaria parasite. Here, numerous protein sequences formulation techniques namely: discrete methods, Biochemical, physiochemical and Natural language processing techniques are applied for transformation of protein sequences in to numerical descriptors. Four classification algorithms are utilized and the anticipated results of these classifiers were then fused to establish ensemble classification model via simple majority and genetic algorithm. In addition, BCH error correction code is incorporated with support vector machine using all the feature spaces. The simulated results demonstrate the remarkable achievement of proposed compared to previous models. Thus, our proposed model may be an effective tool for discriminating the secretory and non-secretory proteins of malaria parasite.	2022	Comput Biol Med

50	36046150	Asian hate speech detection on Twitter during COVID-19.	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) started in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, and after being utterly contagious in Asian countries, it rapidly spread to other countries. This disease caused governments worldwide to declare a public health crisis with severe measures taken to reduce the speed of the spread of the disease. This pandemic affected the lives of millions of people. Many citizens that lost their loved ones and jobs experienced a wide range of emotions, such as disbelief, shock, concerns about health, fear about food supplies, anxiety, and panic. All of the aforementioned phenomena led to the spread of racism and hate against Asians in western countries, especially in the United States. An analysis of official preliminary police data by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University shows that Anti-Asian hate crime in 16 of America's largest cities increased by 149% in 2020. In this study, we first chose a baseline of Americans' hate crimes against Asians on Twitter. Then we present an approach to balance the biased dataset and consequently improve the performance of tweet classification. We also have downloaded 10 million tweets through the Twitter API V-2. In this study, we have used a small portion of that, and we will use the entire dataset in the future study. In this article, three thousand tweets from our collected corpus are annotated by four annotators, including three Asian and one Asian-American. Using this data, we built predictive models of hate speech using various machine learning and deep learning methods. Our machine learning methods include Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes. Our Deep Learning models include Basic Long-Term Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional LSTM with Drop out, Convolution, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). We also adjusted our dataset by filtering tweets that were ambiguous to the annotators based on low Fleiss Kappa agreement between annotators. Our final result showed that Logistic Regression achieved the best statistical machine learning performance with an F1 score of 0.72, while BERT achieved the best performance of the deep learning models, with an F1-Score of 0.85.	2022	Front Artif Intell
51	36045644	A learner corpus is born this way: From raw data to processed dataset.	This data article presents the development of a learner corpus (i.e. a systematic computerized web-based repository of written texts produced by language learners) from the initial phase of the development where written assignments were collected from language learners as raw data to the critical phases where the processed text data and meta data were aligned and transformed to the web interface of the corpus. The corpus developed is called the CELL (Chinese and English Learner Language) Corpus, which comprises: i) text data containing 4.2 million English words and 18 million Chinese characters; and ii) meta data including the demographic information of the participants whose text data were collected. This article first outlines the steps for collecting the text data and meta data and then explains the processes for cleaning, annotating and tagging the text data. Discussion of the problems the research team encountered with segmentation of the Chinese text data and accuracy check of the processed datasets is also included in this article. The CELL Corpus comes with the concordance and word list features which will enable language teachers and researchers to investigate frequency, accuracy and complexity of vocabulary use in learner language. The steps and processes reported in this article will inform future development of learner language corpora of different languages.	2022	Data Brief
52	36044254	Effect of Applying a Real-Time Medical Record Input Assistance System With Voice Artificial Intelligence on Triage Task Performance in the Emergency Department: Prospective Interventional Study.	"BACKGROUND: Natural language processing has been established as an important tool when using unstructured text data; however, most studies in the medical field have been limited to a retrospective analysis of text entered manually by humans. Little research has focused on applying natural language processing to the conversion of raw voice data generated in the clinical field into text using speech-to-text algorithms.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigated the promptness and reliability of a real-time medical record input assistance system with voice artificial intelligence (RMIS-AI) and compared it to the manual method for triage tasks in the emergency department.
METHODS: From June 4, 2021, to September 12, 2021, RMIS-AI, using a machine learning engine trained with 1717 triage cases over 6 months, was prospectively applied in clinical practice in a triage unit. We analyzed a total of 1063 triage tasks performed by 19 triage nurses who agreed to participate. The primary outcome was the time for participants to perform the triage task.
RESULTS: The median time for participants to perform the triage task was 204 (IQR 155, 277) seconds by RMIS-AI and 231 (IQR 180, 313) seconds using manual method; this difference was statistically significant (P<.001). Most variables required for entry in the triage note showed a higher record completion rate by the manual method, but in the recording of additional chief concerns and past medical history, RMIS-AI showed a higher record completion rate than the manual method. Categorical variables entered by RMIS-AI showed less accuracy compared with continuous variables, such as vital signs.
CONCLUSIONS: RMIS-AI improves the promptness in performing triage tasks as compared to using the manual input method. However, to make it a reliable alternative to the conventional method, technical supplementation and additional research should be pursued."	2022	JMIR Med Inform
53	36044253	Multicenter Validation of Natural Language Processing Algorithms for the Detection of Common Data Elements in Operative Notes for Total Hip Arthroplasty: Algorithm Development and Validation.	"BACKGROUND: Natural language processing (NLP) methods are powerful tools for extracting and analyzing critical information from free-text data. MedTaggerIE, an open-source NLP pipeline for information extraction based on text patterns, has been widely used in the annotation of clinical notes. A rule-based system, MedTagger-total hip arthroplasty (THA), developed based on MedTaggerIE, was previously shown to correctly identify the surgical approach, fixation, and bearing surface from the THA operative notes at Mayo Clinic.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the implementability, usability, and portability of MedTagger-THA at two external institutions, Michigan Medicine and the University of Iowa, and provide lessons learned for best practices.
METHODS: We conducted iterative test-apply-refinement processes with three involved sites-the development site (Mayo Clinic) and two deployment sites (Michigan Medicine and the University of Iowa). Mayo Clinic was the primary NLP development site, with the THA registry as the gold standard. The activities at the two deployment sites included the extraction of the operative notes, gold standard development (Michigan: registry data; Iowa: manual chart review), the refinement of NLP algorithms on training data, and the evaluation of test data. Error analyses were conducted to understand language variations across sites. To further assess the model specificity for approach and fixation, we applied the refined MedTagger-THA to arthroscopic hip procedures and periacetabular osteotomy cases, as neither of these operative notes should contain any approach or fixation keywords.
RESULTS: MedTagger-THA algorithms were implemented and refined independently for both sites. At Michigan, the study comprised THA-related notes for 2569 patient-date pairs. Before model refinement, MedTagger-THA algorithms demonstrated excellent accuracy for approach (96.6%, 95% CI 94.6%-97.9%) and fixation (95.7%, 95% CI 92.4%-97.6%). These results were comparable with internal accuracy at the development site (99.2% for approach and 90.7% for fixation). Model refinement improved accuracies slightly for both approach (99%, 95% CI 97.6%-99.6%) and fixation (98%, 95% CI 95.3%-99.3%). The specificity of approach identification was 88.9% for arthroscopy cases, and the specificity of fixation identification was 100% for both periacetabular osteotomy and arthroscopy cases. At the Iowa site, the study comprised an overall data set of 100 operative notes (50 training notes and 50 test notes). MedTagger-THA algorithms achieved moderate-high performance on the training data. After model refinement, the model achieved high performance for approach (100%, 95% CI 91.3%-100%), fixation (98%, 95% CI 88.3%-100%), and bearing surface (92%, 95% CI 80.5%-97.3%).
CONCLUSIONS: High performance across centers was achieved for the MedTagger-THA algorithms, demonstrating that they were sufficiently implementable, usable, and portable to different deployment sites. This study provided important lessons learned during the model deployment and validation processes, and it can serve as a reference for transferring rule-based electronic health record models."	2022	JMIR Med Inform
54	36042870	Ethical Considerations in the Application of Artificial Intelligence to Monitor Social Media for COVID-19 Data.	The COVID-19 pandemic and its related policies (e.g., stay at home and social distancing orders) have increased people's use of digital technology, such as social media. Researchers have, in turn, utilized artificial intelligence to analyze social media data for public health surveillance. For example, through machine learning and natural language processing, they have monitored social media data to examine public knowledge and behavior. This paper explores the ethical considerations of using artificial intelligence to monitor social media to understand the public's perspectives and behaviors surrounding COVID-19, including potential risks and benefits of an AI-driven approach. Importantly, investigators and ethics committees have a role in ensuring that researchers adhere to ethical principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in a way that moves science forward while ensuring public safety and confidence in the process.	2022	Minds Mach (Dordr)
55	36041853	General auditory and speech-specific contributions to cortical envelope tracking revealed using auditory chimeras.	"In recent years research on natural speech processing has benefited from recognizing that low frequency cortical activity tracks the amplitude envelope of natural speech. However, it remains unclear to what extent this tracking reflects speech-specific processing beyond the analysis of the stimulus acoustics. In the present study, we aimed to disentangle contributions to cortical envelope tracking that reflect general acoustic processing from those that are functionally related to processing speech. To do so, we recorded EEG from subjects as they listened to ""auditory chimeras"" - stimuli comprised of the temporal fine structure (TFS) of one speech stimulus modulated by the amplitude envelope (ENV) of another speech stimulus. By varying the number of frequency bands used in making the chimeras, we obtained some control over which speech stimulus was recognized by the listener. No matter which stimulus was recognized, envelope tracking was always strongest for the ENV stimulus, indicating a dominant contribution from acoustic processing. However, there was also a positive relationship between intelligibility and the tracking of the perceived speech, indicating a contribution from speech specific processing. These findings were supported by a follow-up analysis that assessed envelope tracking as a function of the (estimated) output of the cochlea rather than the original stimuli used in creating the chimeras. Finally, we sought to isolate the speech-specific contribution to envelope tracking using forward encoding models and found that indices of phonetic feature processing tracked reliably with intelligibility. Together these results show that cortical speech tracking is dominated by acoustic processing, but also reflects speech-specific processing."	2022	J Neurosci

"BACKGROUND: Electronic health records (EHRs) with large sample sizes and rich information offer great potential for dementia research, but current methods of phenotyping cognitive status are not scalable.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether natural language processing (NLP)-powered semiautomated annotation can improve the speed and interrater reliability of chart reviews for phenotyping cognitive status.
METHODS: In this diagnostic study, we developed and evaluated a semiautomated NLP-powered annotation tool (NAT) to facilitate phenotyping of cognitive status. Clinical experts adjudicated the cognitive status of 627 patients at Mass General Brigham (MGB) health care, using NAT or traditional chart reviews. Patient charts contained EHR data from two data sets: (1) records from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, for 100 Medicare beneficiaries from the MGB Accountable Care Organization and (2) records from 2 years prior to COVID-19 diagnosis to the date of COVID-19 diagnosis for 527 MGB patients. All EHR data from the relevant period were extracted; diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory test values were processed and summarized; clinical notes were processed through an NLP pipeline; and a web tool was developed to present an integrated view of all data. Cognitive status was rated as cognitively normal, cognitively impaired, or undetermined. Assessment time and interrater agreement of NAT compared to manual chart reviews for cognitive status phenotyping was evaluated.
RESULTS: NAT adjudication provided higher interrater agreement (Cohen κ=0.89 vs κ=0.80) and significant speed up (time difference mean 1.4, SD 1.3 minutes; P<.001; ratio median 2.2, min-max 0.4-20) over manual chart reviews. There was moderate agreement with manual chart reviews (Cohen κ=0.67). In the cases that exhibited disagreement with manual chart reviews, NAT adjudication was able to produce assessments that had broader clinical consensus due to its integrated view of highlighted relevant information and semiautomated NLP features.
CONCLUSIONS: NAT adjudication improves the speed and interrater reliability for phenotyping cognitive status compared to manual chart reviews. This study underscores the potential of an NLP-based clinically adjudicated method to build large-scale dementia research cohorts from EHRs."	2022	J Med Internet Res
58	36040781	Analyzing Suicide Risk From Linguistic Features in Social Media: Evaluation Study.	"BACKGROUND: Effective suicide risk assessments and interventions are vital for suicide prevention. Although assessing such risks is best done by health care professionals, people experiencing suicidal ideation may not seek help. Hence, machine learning (ML) and computational linguistics can provide analytical tools for understanding and analyzing risks. This, therefore, facilitates suicide intervention and prevention.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore, using statistical analyses and ML, whether computerized language analysis could be applied to assess and better understand a person's suicide risk on social media.
METHODS: We used the University of Maryland Suicidality Dataset comprising text posts written by users (N=866) of mental health-related forums on Reddit. Each user was classified with a suicide risk rating (no, low, moderate, or severe) by either medical experts or crowdsourced annotators, denoting their estimated likelihood of dying by suicide. In language analysis, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count lexicon assessed sentiment, thinking styles, and part of speech, whereas readability was explored using the TextStat library. The Mann-Whitney U test identified differences between at-risk (low, moderate, and severe risk) and no-risk users. Meanwhile, the Kruskal-Wallis test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used for granular analysis between risk levels and to identify redundancy, respectively. In the ML experiments, gradient boost, random forest, and support vector machine models were trained using 10-fold cross validation. The area under the receiver operator curve and F
RESULTS: Statistically significant differences (P<.05) were identified between the at-risk (671/866, 77.5%) and no-risk groups (195/866, 22.5%). This was true for both the crowd- and expert-annotated samples. Overall, at-risk users had higher median values for most variables (authenticity, first-person pronouns, and negation), with a notable exception of clout, which indicated that at-risk users were less likely to engage in social posturing. A high positive correlation (ρ>0.84) was present between the part of speech variables, which implied redundancy and demonstrated the utility of aggregate features. All ML models performed similarly in their area under the curve (0.66-0.68); however, the random forest and gradient boost models were noticeably better in their F
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our statistical analyses found linguistic features associated with suicide risk, such as social posturing (eg, authenticity and clout), first-person singular pronouns, and negation. This increased our understanding of the behavioral and thought patterns of social media users and provided insights into the mechanisms behind ML models. We also demonstrated the applicative potential of ML in assisting health care professionals to assess and manage individuals experiencing suicide risk."	2022	JMIR Form Res
59	36040760	Search Term Identification Methods for Computational Health Communication: Word Embedding and Network Approach for Health Content on YouTube.	"BACKGROUND: Common methods for extracting content in health communication research typically involve using a set of well-established queries, often names of medical procedures or diseases, that are often technical or rarely used in the public discussion of health topics. Although these methods produce high recall (ie, retrieve highly relevant content), they tend to overlook health messages that feature colloquial language and layperson vocabularies on social media. Given how such messages could contain misinformation or obscure content that circumvents official medical concepts, correctly identifying (and analyzing) them is crucial to the study of user-generated health content on social media platforms.
OBJECTIVE: Health communication scholars would benefit from a retrieval process that goes beyond the use of standard terminologies as search queries. Motivated by this, this study aims to put forward a search term identification method to improve the retrieval of user-generated health content on social media. We focused on cancer screening tests as a subject and YouTube as a platform case study.
METHODS: We retrieved YouTube videos using cancer screening procedures (colonoscopy, fecal occult blood test, mammogram, and pap test) as seed queries. We then trained word embedding models using text features from these videos to identify the nearest neighbor terms that are semantically similar to cancer screening tests in colloquial language. Retrieving more YouTube videos from the top neighbor terms, we coded a sample of 150 random videos from each term for relevance. We then used text mining to examine the new content retrieved from these videos and network analysis to inspect the relations between the newly retrieved videos and videos from the seed queries.
RESULTS: The top terms with semantic similarities to cancer screening tests were identified via word embedding models. Text mining analysis showed that the 5 nearest neighbor terms retrieved content that was novel and contextually diverse, beyond the content retrieved from cancer screening concepts alone. Results from network analysis showed that the newly retrieved videos had at least one total degree of connection (sum of indegree and outdegree) with seed videos according to YouTube relatedness measures.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a retrieval technique to improve recall and minimize precision loss, which can be extended to various health topics on YouTube, a popular video-sharing social media platform. We discussed how health communication scholars can apply the technique to inspect the performance of the retrieval strategy before investing human coding resources and outlined suggestions on how such a technique can be extended to other health contexts."	2022	JMIR Med Inform

62	36038793	Reduced Neural Specialization for Word-level Linguistic Prosody in Children with Autism.	Children with autism often show atypical brain lateralization for speech and language processing, however, it is unclear what linguistic component contributes to this phenomenon. Here we measured event-related potential (ERP) responses in 21 school-age autistic children and 25 age-matched neurotypical (NT) peers during listening to word-level prosodic stimuli. We found that both groups displayed larger late negative response (LNR) amplitude to native prosody than to nonnative prosody; however, unlike the NT group exhibiting left-lateralized LNR distinction of prosodic phonology, the autism group showed no evidence of LNR lateralization. Moreover, in both groups, the LNR effects were only present for prosodic phonology but not for phoneme-free prosodic acoustics. These results extended the findings of inadequate neural specialization for language in autism to sub-lexical prosodic structures.	2022	J Autism Dev Disord

64	36038567	Le Petit Prince multilingual naturalistic fMRI corpus.	Neuroimaging using more ecologically valid stimuli such as audiobooks has advanced our understanding of natural language comprehension in the brain. However, prior naturalistic stimuli have typically been restricted to a single language, which limited generalizability beyond small typological domains. Here we present the Le Petit Prince fMRI Corpus (LPPC-fMRI), a multilingual resource for research in the cognitive neuroscience of speech and language during naturalistic listening (OpenNeuro: ds003643). 49 English speakers, 35 Chinese speakers and 28 French speakers listened to the same audiobook The Little Prince in their native language while multi-echo functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. We also provide time-aligned speech annotation and word-by-word predictors obtained using natural language processing tools. The resulting timeseries data are shown to be of high quality with good temporal signal-to-noise ratio and high inter-subject correlation. Data-driven functional analyses provide further evidence of data quality. This annotated, multilingual fMRI dataset facilitates future re-analysis that addresses cross-linguistic commonalities and differences in the neural substrate of language processing on multiple perceptual and linguistic levels.	2022	Sci Data
65	36038066	Improvement of intervention information detection for automated clinical literature screening during systematic review.	Systematic literature review (SLR) is a crucial method for clinicians and policymakers to make their decisions in a flood of new clinical studies. Because manual literature screening in SLR is a highly laborious task, its automation by natural language processing (NLP) has been welcomed. Although intervention is a key information for literature screening, NLP models for its detection in previous works have not shown adequate performance. In this work, we first design an algorithm for automated construction of high-quality intervention labels by utilizing information retrieved from a clinical trial database. We then design another algorithm for improving model's recall and F1 score by imposing adaptive weights on training instances in the loss function. The intervention detection model trained on the weighted datasets is tested with the Evidence-Based Medicine NLP (EBM-NLP) corpus, and shows 9.7% and 4.0% improvements respectively in recall and F1 score compared to the previous state-of-the-art model on the corpus. The proposed algorithms can boost automation of literature screening during SLR in the clinical domain.	2022	J Biomed Inform

"BACKGROUND: Based on recent researches on the use of natural language processing techniques for very early detection of cognitive decline and the benefits of cognitive stimulation for people with cognitive impairments, the Dementia Monitoring application (DMapp) is developed inside the Memento project.
AIMS: The aims of this work are: (1) to present DMapp; (2) to report the results of two preliminary studies on DMapp; (3) to describe the clinical and experimental potentiality of DMapp.
METHODS: Italian people with the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or dementia due to Alzheimer's Disease with a Mini-Mental-State-Examination between 24 and 28 (inclusive) were involved in the DMapp development prototype during the Lab Trial (4 subjects) and Filed Trial (5 subjects) of the Memento project. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected to evaluate participants' opinions, the DMapp ability to perform the automatic analysis of the speech and participants' visible emotional state effective. Ad hoc interviews, the Observed Emotion Rating Scale and performance metrics to solve different tasks were used. The relation between cognitive measures (global cognitive measures) and linguistic indexes values was considered using Euclidean distances between the participants.
RESULTS: Linguistic indexes were calculated and seemed to classify the participants' performance as expected from cognitive measures. The DMapp was appreciated by people with cognitive impairment. Positive emotions were present.
CONCLUSION: DMapp seems an interesting approach to monitor dementia symptoms progression and stimulate memory. Possible developments and open questions are discussed."	2022	Aging Clin Exp Res
67	36035322	ApaNet: adversarial perturbations alleviation network for face verification.	Albeit Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition, they have been discovered to be fragile to adversarial attacks. Specifically, in computer vision, an attacker can easily deceive DNNs by contaminating an input image with perturbations imperceptible to humans. As one of the important vision tasks, face verification is also subject to adversarial attack. Thus, in this paper, we focus on defending against the adversarial attack for face verification to mitigate the potential risk. We learn a network via an implementation of stacked residual blocks, namely adversarial perturbations alleviation network (ApaNet), to alleviate latent adversarial perturbations hidden in the input facial image. During the supervised learning of ApaNet, only the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) is used as the training set, and the legitimate examples and corresponding adversarial examples produced by projected gradient descent algorithm compose supervision and inputs respectively. By leveraging the middle and high layer's activation of FaceNet, the discrepancy between an image output by ApaNet and the supervision is calculated as the loss function to optimize ApaNet. Empirical experiment results on the LFW, YouTube Faces DB and CASIA-FaceV5 confirm the effectiveness of the proposed defender against some representative white-box and black-box adversarial attacks. Also, experimental results show the superiority performance of the ApaNet as comparing with several currently available techniques.	2022	Multimed Tools Appl

Mental illness leading to suicide attempts is prevalent in a large portion of the population especially in low and middle-income nations. There remains a significant social stigma associated with mental illness that can lead to stigmatization of patients. Hence, patients are reluctant to communicate their problems to health care providers. Physicians have difficulty in timely identification of patients at risk for suicide. Novel and rigorously designed strategies are needed to determine the population at risk for suicide. This would be the first step in overcoming the multitude of barriers in the management of mental illness. Clinical tools and the use of electronic medical records (EMR) are time intensive.

70	36033768	An efficient modular framework for automatic LIONC classification of MedIMG using unified medical language.	Handwritten prescriptions and radiological reports: doctors use handwritten prescriptions and radiological reports to give drugs to patients who have illnesses, injuries, or other problems. Clinical text data, like physician prescription visuals and radiology reports, should be labelled with specific information such as disease type, features, and anatomical location for more effective use. The semantic annotation of vast collections of biological and biomedical texts, like scientific papers, medical reports, and general practitioner observations, has lately been examined by doctors and scientists. By identifying and disambiguating references to biomedical concepts in texts, medical semantics annotators could generate such annotations automatically. For Medical Images (MedIMG), we provide a methodology for learning an effective holistic representation (handwritten word pictures as well as radiology reports). Deep Learning (DL) methods have recently gained much interest for their capacity to achieve expert-level accuracy in automated MedIMG analysis. We discovered that tasks requiring significant responsive fields are ideal for downscaled input images that are qualitatively verified by examining functional, responsive areas and class activating maps for training models. This article focuses on the following contributions: (a) Information Extraction from Narrative MedImages, (b) Automatic categorisation on image resolution with an impact on MedIMG, and (c) Hybrid Model to Predictions of Named Entity Recognition utilising RNN + LSTM + GRM that perform admirably in every trainee for every input purpose. At the same time, supplying understandable scale weight implies that such multi-scale structures are also crucial for extracting information from high-resolution MedIMG. A portion of the reports (30%) are manually evaluated by trained physicians, while the rest were automatically categorised using deep supervised training models based on attention mechanisms and supplied with test reports. MetaMapLite proved recall and precision, but also an F1-score equivalent for primary biomedicine text search techniques and medical text examination on many databases of MedIMG. In addition to implementing as well as getting the requirements for MedIMG, the article explores the quality of medical data by using DL techniques for reaching large-scale labelled clinical data and also the significance of their real-time efforts in the biomedical study that have played an instrumental role in its extramural diffusion and global appeal.	2022	Front Public Health
71	36033023	Leveraging a multidimensional linguistic analysis of constructed responses produced by college readers.	The goal of this study was to assess the relationships between computational approaches to analyzing constructed responses made during reading and individual differences in the foundational skills of reading in college readers. We also explored if these relationships were consistent across texts and samples collected at different institutions and texts. The study made use of archival data that involved college participants who produced typed constructed responses under thinking aloud instructions reading history and science texts. They also took assessments of vocabulary knowledge and proficiency in comprehension. The protocols were analyzed to assess two different ways to determine their cohesion. One approach involved assessing how readers established connections with themselves (i.e., to other constructed responses they produced). The other approach involved assessing connections between the constructed responses and the texts that were read. Additionally, the comparisons were made by assessing both lexical (i.e., word matching) and semantic (i.e., high dimensional semantic spaces) comparisons. The result showed that both approaches for analyzing cohesion and making the comparisons were correlated with vocabulary knowledge and comprehension proficiency. The implications of the results for theory and practice are discussed.	2022	Front Psychol
72	36032678	Medical terminology-based computing system: a lightweight post-processing solution for out-of-vocabulary multi-word terms.	The linguistic rules of medical terminology assist in gaining acquaintance with rare/complex clinical and biomedical terms. The medical language follows a Greek and Latin-inspired nomenclature. This nomenclature aids the stakeholders in simplifying the medical terms and gaining semantic familiarity. However, natural language processing models misrepresent rare and complex biomedical words. In this study, we present MedTCS-a lightweight, post-processing module-to simplify hybridized or compound terms into regular words using medical nomenclature. MedTCS enabled the word-based embedding models to achieve 100% coverage and enabled the BiowordVec model to achieve high correlation scores (0.641 and 0.603 in UMNSRS similarity and relatedness datasets, respectively) that significantly surpass the n-gram and sub-word approaches of FastText and BERT. In the downstream task of named entity recognition (NER), MedTCS enabled the latest clinical embedding model of FastText-OA-All-300d to improve the F1-score from 0.45 to 0.80 on the BC5CDR corpus and from 0.59 to 0.81 on the NCBI-Disease corpus, respectively. Similarly, in the drug indication classification task, our model was able to increase the coverage by 9% and the F1-score by 1%. Our results indicate that incorporating a medical terminology-based module provides distinctive contextual clues to enhance vocabulary as a post-processing step on pre-trained embeddings. We demonstrate that the proposed module enables the word embedding models to generate vectors of out-of-vocabulary words effectively. We expect that our study can be a stepping stone for the use of biomedical knowledge-driven resources in NLP.	2022	Front Mol Biosci

75	36031266	Workplace violence during the COVID-19 pandemic: March-October, 2020, United States.	"PROBLEM: COVID-19 has impacted United States workers and workplaces in multiple ways including workplace violence events (WVEs). This analysis scanned online media sources to identify and describe the characteristics of WVEs related to COVID-19 occurring in the United States during the early phases of the pandemic.
METHOD: Publicly available online media reports were searched for COVID-19-related WVEs during March 1-October 31, 2020. A list of 41 keywords was used to scan four search engines using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Authors manually reviewed media reports for inclusion using the study definition and to code variables of interest. Descriptive statistics were calculated across three types of violence: non-physical, physical, and events with both physical and non-physical violence.
RESULTS: The search of media reports found 400 WVEs related to COVID-19 during March 1-October 31, 2020. Of the WVEs, 27% (n = 108) involved non-physical violence, 27% (n = 109) physical violence, and 41% (n = 164) both physical and non-physical violence. Nineteen WVEs could not be assigned to a specific type of violence (5%). Most occurred in retail and dining establishments (n = 192, 48%; n = 74, 19%, respectively). Most WVEs related to COVID-19 were perpetrated by a customer or client (n = 298, 75%), but some were perpetrated by a worker (n = 61, 15%). Most perpetrators were males (n = 234, 59%) and acted alone (n = 313, 79%). The majority of WVEs were related to mask disputes (n = 286, 72%). In 22% of the WVEs, the perpetrator coughed or spit on a worker while threatening infection from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
DISCUSSION: This analysis demonstrated that media scraping may be useful for workplace violence surveillance. The pandemic resulted in unique violent events, including those perpetrated by workers. Typical workplace violence prevention strategies may not be effective in reducing COVID-19-related violence. More research on workplace training for workers during public health crises is needed."	2022	J Safety Res
76	36029890	Natural Language Processing in Radiology: Update on Clinical Applications.	Radiological reports are a valuable source of information used to guide clinical care and support research. Organizing and managing this content, however, frequently requires several manual curations due to the more common unstructured nature of the reports. However, manual review of these reports for clinical knowledge extraction is costly and time-consuming. Natural language processing (NLP) is a set of methods developed to extract structured meaning from a body of text and can be used to optimize the workflow of health care professionals. Specifically, NLP methods can help radiologists as decision support systems and improve the management of patients' medical data. In this study, we highlight the opportunities offered by NLP in the field of radiology. A comprehensive review of the most commonly used NLP methods to extract information from radiological reports and the development of tools to improve radiological workflow using this information is presented. Finally, we review the important limitations of these tools and discuss the relevant observations and trends in the application of NLP to radiology that could benefit the field in the future.	2022	J Am Coll Radiol
77	36029230	A novel Artificial Intelligence-based tool to assess anticholinergic burden: a survey.	"BACKGROUND: many medications possess anticholinergic activity. Their use is associated with a number of serious adverse effects including cognitive effects. The cumulative anticholinergic effect of medications as assessed by tools such as the anticholinergic burden scale (AchB) can identify people particularly at risk of anticholinergic side-effects. Currently, >20 tools are available for clinicians to use, but there is no consensus on the most appropriate tool.
METHODS: a newly created online tool-International Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Tool (IACT)-based on natural language processing and chemical structure analysis, was developed and made available for clinicians to test its functions. We carried out a survey (between 8th of February and 31st of March 2021) to assess the overall need for an assessment tool as well as the usability of the IACT.
RESULTS: a total of 110 responses were received from different countries and practitioners' groups. The majority of the participants (86.11%) stated they would use a tool for AchB assessment if available and when they were asked to rate the IACT against other tools, amongst 34 responders, 20.59% rated it better and 8.82% rated it significantly better, 44.12% rated it neither better, nor worse, 14.71% rated it worse and 11.76% somewhat worse.
CONCLUSION: there is a need for an anticholinergic burden calculator to assess the anticholinergicity of medications. Tools such as the IACT potentially could meet this demand due to its ability to assign scores to current and new medications appearing on the market based both on their chemical structure and reported adverse pharmacological effects."	2022	Age Ageing
78	36018838	Taxonomic classification of DNA sequences beyond sequence similarity using deep neural networks.	Taxonomic classification, that is, the assignment to biological clades with shared ancestry, is a common task in genetics, mainly based on a genome similarity search of large genome databases. The classification quality depends heavily on the database, since representative relatives must be present. Many genomic sequences cannot be classified at all or only with a high misclassification rate. Here we present BERTax, a deep neural network program based on natural language processing to precisely classify the superkingdom and phylum of DNA sequences taxonomically without the need for a known representative relative from a database. We show BERTax to be at least on par with the state-of-the-art approaches when taxonomically similar species are part of the training data. For novel organisms, however, BERTax clearly outperforms any existing approach. Finally, we show that BERTax can also be combined with database approaches to further increase the prediction quality in almost all cases. Since BERTax is not based on similar entries in databases, it allows precise taxonomic classification of a broader range of genomic sequences, thus increasing the overall information gain.	2022	Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A
79	36017500	dialogi: Utilising NLP With Chemical and Disease Similarities to Drive the Identification of Drug-Induced Liver Injury Literature.	"Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI), despite its low occurrence rate, can cause severe side effects or even lead to death. Thus, it is one of the leading causes for terminating the development of new, and restricting the use of already-circulating, drugs. Moreover, its multifactorial nature, combined with a clinical presentation that often mimics other liver diseases, complicate the identification of DILI-related (or ""positive"") literature, which remains the main medium for sourcing results from the clinical practice and experimental studies. This work-contributing to the ""Literature AI for DILI Challenge"" of the Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis (CAMDA) 2021- presents an automated pipeline for distinguishing between DILI-positive and negative publications. We used Natural Language Processing (NLP) to filter out the uninformative parts of a text, and identify and extract mentions of chemicals and diseases. We combined that information with small-molecule and disease embeddings, which are capable of capturing chemical and disease similarities, to improve classification performance. The former were directly sourced from the Chemical Checker (CC). For the latter, we collected data that encode different aspects of disease similarity from the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus and the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Following a similar procedure as the one used in the CC, vector representations for diseases were learnt and evaluated. Two Neural Network (NN) classifiers were developed: a baseline model that accepts texts as input and an augmented, extended, model that also utilises chemical and disease embeddings. We trained, validated, and tested the classifiers through a Nested Cross-Validation (NCV) scheme with 10 outer and 5 inner folds. During this, the baseline and extended models performed virtually identically, with F"	2022	Front Genet
80	36016474	Frontoparietal and temporal white matter diffusion MRI in children and youth with prenatal alcohol exposure.	"BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is associated with brain alterations and neurocognitive deficits, but relationships between brain alterations and neurocognitive deficits remain unclear.
METHODS: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were obtained from 31 participants with PAE and 31 unexposed controls aged 7-15 years. Mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were derived from the genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral cingulum, and inferior and superior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF, SLF). Participants completed language subtests from the NEPSY-II. Executive functioning was measured using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF-PR) and verbal learning was assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test-Children's Version (CVLT-C) only in children with PAE. Group differences in diffusion metrics and cognitive scores were tested. Principal component analysis was used to reduce redundancy in cognitive and behavior variables; associations between components and brain measures were then assessed.
RESULTS: Children with PAE had lower MD in the right SLF compared with unexposed controls. FA was positively related to age in 6 of 9 tracts and MD negatively related to age in all tracts; there were no significant age-by-group interactions. Participants with PAE scored lower than unexposed peers on the NEPSY-II Comprehension of Instructions and Phonological Processing and above population norms (indicating worse performance) on the BRIEF-PR. Children with PAE had a negative association between a principal component closely associated with Speeded Naming and FA in the left SLF (PAE: p = 0.002) and left ILF (PAE: p = 0.002); unexposed controls showed no significant associations.
CONCLUSION: We found widespread cognitive difficulties in children with PAE, but relatively limited differences in brain metrics and associations with age. Different brain-cognitive relationships were found in children with PAE compared with controls. Overall, the results provide additional evidence that PAE may lead to cognitive difficulties and disrupt typical brain-function relationships."	2022	Alcohol Clin Exp Res
81	36016280	Finding Asymptomatic Spreaders in a COVID-19 Transmission Network by Graph Attention Networks.	In the COVID-19 epidemic the mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic infections generate a substantial portion of virus spread; these undetected individuals make it difficult to assess the effectiveness of preventive measures as most epidemic prevention strategies are based on the detected data. Effectively identifying the undetected infections in local transmission will be of great help in COVID-19 control. In this work, we propose an RNA virus transmission network representation model based on graph attention networks (RVTR); this model is constructed using the principle of natural language processing to learn the information of gene sequence and using a graph attention network to catch the topological character of COVID-19 transmission networks. Since SARS-CoV-2 will mutate when it spreads, our approach makes use of graph context loss function, which can reflect that the genetic sequence of infections with close spreading relation will be more similar than those with a long distance, to train our model. Our approach shows its ability to find asymptomatic spreaders both on simulated and real COVID-19 datasets and performs better when compared with other network representation and feature extraction methods.	2022	Viruses
82	36011981	Leveraging Reddit for Suicidal Ideation Detection: A Review of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing Techniques.	Suicide is a major public-health problem that exists in virtually every part of the world. Hundreds of thousands of people commit suicide every year. The early detection of suicidal ideation is critical for suicide prevention. However, there are challenges associated with conventional suicide-risk screening methods. At the same time, individuals contemplating suicide are increasingly turning to social media and online forums, such as Reddit, to express their feelings and share their struggles with suicidal thoughts. This prompted research that applies machine learning and natural language processing techniques to detect suicidality among social media and forum users. The objective of this paper is to investigate methods employed to detect suicidal ideations on the Reddit forum. To achieve this objective, we conducted a literature review of the recent articles detailing machine learning and natural language processing techniques applied to Reddit data to detect the presence of suicidal ideations. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we selected 26 recent studies, published between 2018 and 2022. The findings of the review outline the prevalent methods of data collection, data annotation, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation. Furthermore, we present several Reddit-based datasets utilized to construct suicidal ideation detection models. Finally, we conclude by discussing the current limitations and future directions in the research of suicidal ideation detection.	2022	Int J Environ Res Public Health
83	36011965	Analyzing Spanish-Language Public Sentiment in the Context of a Pandemic and Social Unrest: The Panama Case.	Over the past decade, an increase in global connectivity and social media users has changed the way in which opinions and sentiments are shared. Platforms such as Twitter can act as public forums for expressing opinions on non-personal matters, but often also as an outlet for individuals to share their feelings and personal thoughts. This becomes especially evident during times of crisis, such as a massive civil disorder or a pandemic. This study proposes the estimation and analysis of sentiments expressed by Twitter users of the Republic of Panama during the years 2019 and 2020. The proposed workflow is comprised of the extraction, quantification, processing and analysis of Spanish-language Twitter data based on Sentiment Analysis. This case of study highlights the importance of developing natural language processing resources explicitly devised for supporting opinion mining applications in Latin American countries, where language regionalisms can drastically change the lexicon on each country. A comparative analysis performed between popular machine learning algorithms demonstrated that a version of a distributed gradient boosting algorithm could infer sentiment polarity contained in Spanish text in an accurate and time-effective manner. This algorithm is the tool used to analyze over 20 million tweets produced between the years of 2019 and 2020 by residents of the Republic of Panama, accurately displaying strong sentiment responses to events occurred in the country over the two years that the analysis performed spanned. The obtained results highlight the potential that methodologies such as the one proposed in this study could have for transparent government monitoring of responses to public policies on a population scale.	2022	Int J Environ Res Public Health

85	36011135	Comparison of Pretraining Models and Strategies for Health-Related Social Media Text Classification.	Pretrained contextual language models proposed in the recent past have been reported to achieve state-of-the-art performances in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including those involving health-related social media data. We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of different pretrained transformer-based models for social media-based health-related text classification tasks. An additional objective was to explore and propose effective pretraining strategies to improve machine learning performance on such datasets and tasks. We benchmarked six transformer-based models that were pretrained with texts from different domains and sources-BERT, RoBERTa, BERTweet, TwitterBERT, BioClinical_BERT, and BioBERT-on 22 social media-based health-related text classification tasks. For the top-performing models, we explored the possibility of further boosting performance by comparing several pretraining strategies: domain-adaptive pretraining (DAPT), source-adaptive pretraining (SAPT), and a novel approach called topic specific pretraining (TSPT). We also attempted to interpret the impacts of distinct pretraining strategies by visualizing document-level embeddings at different stages of the training process. RoBERTa outperformed BERTweet on most tasks, and better than others. BERT, TwitterBERT, BioClinical_BERT and BioBERT consistently underperformed. For pretraining strategies, SAPT performed better or comparable to the off-the-shelf models, and significantly outperformed DAPT. SAPT + TSPT showed consistently high performance, with statistically significant improvement in three tasks. Our findings demonstrate that RoBERTa and BERTweet are excellent off-the-shelf models for health-related social media text classification, and extended pretraining using SAPT and TSPT can further improve performance.	2022	Healthcare (Basel)

Patients with intracranial artery stenosis show high incidence of stroke. Angiography reports contain rich but underutilized information that can enable the detection of cerebrovascular diseases. This study evaluated various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to accurately identify eleven intracranial artery stenosis from angiography reports. Three NLP models, including a rule-based model, a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a contextualized language model, XLNet, were developed and evaluated by internal-external cross-validation. In this study, angiography reports from two independent medical centers (9614 for training and internal validation testing and 315 as external validation) were assessed. The internal testing results showed that XLNet had the best performance, with a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) ranging from 0.97 to 0.99 using eleven targeted arteries. The rule-based model attained an AUROC from 0.92 to 0.96, and the RNN long short-term memory model attained an AUROC from 0.95 to 0.97. The study showed the potential application of NLP techniques such as the XLNet model for the routine and automatic screening of patients with high risk of intracranial artery stenosis using angiography reports. However, the NLP models were investigated based on relatively small sample sizes with very different report writing styles and a prevalence of stenosis case distributions, revealing challenges for model generalization.	2022	Diagnostics (Basel)
87	36006843	Do syntactic trees enhance Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models for chemical-drug relation extraction?	Collecting relations between chemicals and drugs is crucial in biomedical research. The pre-trained transformer model, e.g. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), is shown to have limitations on biomedical texts; more specifically, the lack of annotated data makes relation extraction (RE) from biomedical texts very challenging. In this paper, we hypothesize that enriching a pre-trained transformer model with syntactic information may help improve its performance on chemical-drug RE tasks. For this purpose, we propose three syntax-enhanced models based on the domain-specific BioBERT model: Chunking-Enhanced-BioBERT and Constituency-Tree-BioBERT in which constituency information is integrated and a Multi-Task-Learning framework Multi-Task-Syntactic (MTS)-BioBERT in which syntactic information is injected implicitly by adding syntax-related tasks as training objectives. Besides, we test an existing model Late-Fusion which is enhanced by syntactic dependency information and build ensemble systems combining syntax-enhanced models and non-syntax-enhanced models. Experiments are conducted on the BioCreative VII DrugProt corpus, a manually annotated corpus for the development and evaluation of RE systems. Our results reveal that syntax-enhanced models in general degrade the performance of BioBERT in the scenario of biomedical RE but improve the performance when the subject-object distance of candidate semantic relation is long. We also explore the impact of quality of dependency parses.

88	36006759	Using natural language processing and machine learning to replace human content coders.	Content analysis is a common and flexible technique to quantify and make sense of qualitative data in psychological research. However, the practical implementation of content analysis is extremely labor-intensive and subject to human coder errors. Applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques can help address these limitations. We explain and illustrate these techniques to psychological researchers. For this purpose, we first present a study exploring the creation of psychometrically meaningful predictions of human content codes. Using an existing database of human content codes, we build an NLP algorithm to validly predict those codes, at generally acceptable standards. We then conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation to model how four dataset characteristics (i.e., sample size, unlabeled proportion of cases, classification base rate, and human coder reliability) influence content classification performance. The simulation indicated that the influence of sample size and unlabeled proportion on model classification performance tended to be curvilinear. In addition, base rate and human coder reliability had a strong effect on classification performance. Finally, using these results, we offer practical recommendations to psychologists on the necessary dataset characteristics to achieve valid prediction of content codes to guide researchers on the use of NLP models to replace human coders in content analysis research.

The analysis of sequences of words and prosody, meter, and rhythm provided in an interview addressing the capacity to identify and describe emotions represents a powerful tool to reveal emotional processing. The ability to express and identify emotions was analyzed by means of the Toronto Structured Interview for Alexithymia (TSIA), and TSIA transcripts were analyzed by Natural Language Processing to shed light on verbal features. The brain correlates of the capacity to translate emotional experience into words were determined through cortical thickness measures. A machine learning methodology proved that individuals with deficits in identifying and describing emotions (n = 7) produced language distortions, frequently used the present tense of auxiliary verbs, and few possessive determiners, as well as scarcely connected the speech, in comparison to individuals without deficits (n = 7). Interestingly, they showed high cortical thickness at left temporal pole and low at isthmus of the right cingulate cortex. Overall, we identified the neuro-linguistic pattern of the expression of emotional experience.	2022	Behav Sci (Basel)

Many interventions to improve the health of individuals with schizophrenia have been created, but on the whole, there has been limited effectiveness in improving quality of life or lifespan. One potential new avenue for inquiry involves a more patient-centric perspective; understanding aspects of physical health most important, and potentially most amenable to change, for individuals based on their life narratives.

As part of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Biologics Effectiveness and Safety initiative, we explored whether machine learning methods, such as natural language processing (NLP), can identify and report transfusion allergic reactions (ARs) from electronic health records (EHRs).
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a 4-year period, all 146 reported transfusion ARs were pulled from a database of 86,764 transfusions in an academic health system, along with a random sample of 605 transfusions without reported ARs. Structured and unstructured EHR data were retrieved, including demographics, new symptoms, medications, and lab results. In unstructured data, evidence from clinicians' notes, test results, and prescriptions fields identified transfusion ARs, which were used to extract NLP features. Clinician reviews of selected validation cases assessed and confirmed model performance.
RESULTS: Clinician reviews of selected validation cases yielded a sensitivity of 67.9% and a specificity of 97.5% at a threshold of 0.9, with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 84%, estimated to 4.5% when extrapolated to match transfusion AR incidence in the full transfusion dataset. A higher threshold achieved sensitivity of 43% with specificity/PPV of 100% in our validation set. Essential features predicting ARs were recognized transfusion reactions, administration of antihistamines or glucocorticoids, and skin symptoms (e.g., hives and itching). Removal of NLP features decreased model performance.
DISCUSSION: NLP algorithms can identify transfusion reactions from the EHR with a reasonable level of precision for subsequent clinician review and confirmation."	2022	Transfusion
92	36004369	Applications of natural language processing in ophthalmology: present and future.	Advances in technology, including novel ophthalmic imaging devices and adoption of the electronic health record (EHR), have resulted in significantly increased data available for both clinical use and research in ophthalmology. While artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have the potential to utilize these data to transform clinical care, current applications of AI in ophthalmology have focused mostly on image-based deep learning. Unstructured free-text in the EHR represents a tremendous amount of underutilized data in big data analyses and predictive AI. Natural language processing (NLP) is a type of AI involved in processing human language that can be used to develop automated algorithms using these vast quantities of available text data. The purpose of this review was to introduce ophthalmologists to NLP by (1) reviewing current applications of NLP in ophthalmology and (2) exploring potential applications of NLP. We reviewed current literature published in Pubmed and Google Scholar for articles related to NLP and ophthalmology, and used ancestor search to expand our references. Overall, we found 19 published studies of NLP in ophthalmology. The majority of these publications (16) focused on extracting specific text such as visual acuity from free-text notes for the purposes of quantitative analysis. Other applications included: domain embedding, predictive modeling, and topic modeling. Future ophthalmic applications of NLP may also focus on developing search engines for data within free-text notes, cleaning notes, automated question-answering, and translating ophthalmology notes for other specialties or for patients, especially with a growing interest in open notes. As medicine becomes more data-oriented, NLP offers increasing opportunities to augment our ability to harness free-text data and drive innovations in healthcare delivery and treatment of ophthalmic conditions.	2022	Front Med (Lausanne)
93	36002778	Application of Deep Learning in Generating Structured Radiology Reports: A Transformer-Based Technique.	Since radiology reports needed for clinical practice and research are written and stored in free-text narrations, extraction of relative information for further analysis is difficult. In these circumstances, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate automatic information extraction and transformation of free-text formats to structured data. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based models have been adapted for NLP experiments with promising results. Despite the significant potential of DL models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), the models face some limitations to implement in clinical practice. Transformers, another new DL architecture, have been increasingly applied to improve the process. Therefore, in this study, we propose a transformer-based fine-grained named entity recognition (NER) architecture for clinical information extraction. We collected 88 abdominopelvic sonography reports in free-text formats and annotated them based on our developed information schema. The text-to-text transfer transformer model (T5) and Scifive, a pre-trained domain-specific adaptation of the T5 model, were applied for fine-tuning to extract entities and relations and transform the input into a structured format. Our transformer-based model in this study outperformed previously applied approaches such as ANN and CNN models based on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and BLEU scores of 0.816, 0.668, 0.528, and 0.743, respectively, while providing an interpretable structured report.	2022	J Digit Imaging
94	36002554	Emotional profiling and cognitive networks unravel how mainstream and alternative press framed AstraZeneca, Pfizer and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns.	"COVID-19 vaccines have been largely debated by the press. To understand how mainstream and alternative media debated vaccines, we introduce a paradigm reconstructing time-evolving narrative frames via cognitive networks and natural language processing. We study Italian news articles massively re-shared on Facebook/Twitter (up to 5 million times), covering 5745 vaccine-related news from 17 news outlets over 8 months. We find consistently high trust/anticipation and low disgust in the way mainstream sources framed ""vaccine/vaccino"". These emotions were crucially missing in alternative outlets. News titles from alternative sources framed ""AstraZeneca"" with sadness, absent in mainstream titles. Initially, mainstream news linked mostly ""Pfizer"" with side effects (e.g. ""allergy"", ""reaction"", ""fever""). With the temporary suspension of ""AstraZeneca"", negative associations shifted: Mainstream titles prominently linked ""AstraZeneca"" with side effects, while ""Pfizer"" underwent a positive valence shift, linked to its higher efficacy. Simultaneously, thrombosis and fearful conceptual associations entered the frame of vaccines, while death changed context, i.e. rather than hopefully preventing deaths, vaccines could be reported as potential causes of death, increasing fear. Our findings expose crucial aspects of the emotional narratives around COVID-19 vaccines adopted by the press, highlighting the need to understand how alternative and mainstream media report vaccination news."	2022	Sci Rep

"INTRODUCTION: The state-of-the-art 3-step Theory of Suicide (3ST) describes why people consider suicide and who will act on their suicidal thoughts and attempt suicide. The central concepts of 3ST-psychological pain, hopelessness, connectedness, and capacity for suicide-are among the most important drivers of suicidal behaviour but they are missing from clinical suicide risk prediction models in use at the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA). These four concepts are not systematically recorded in structured fields of VHA's electronic healthcare records. Therefore, this study will develop a domain-specific ontology that will enable automated extraction of these concepts from clinical progress notes using natural language processing (NLP), and test whether NLP-based predictors for these concepts improve accuracy of existing VHA suicide risk prediction models.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Our mixed-method study has an exploratory sequential design where a qualitative component (aim 1) will inform quantitative analyses (aims 2 and 3). For aim 1, subject matter experts will manually annotate progress notes of clinical encounters with veterans who attempted or died by suicide to develop a domain-specific ontology for the 3ST concepts. During aim 2, we will use NLP to machine-annotate clinical progress notes and derive longitudinal representations for each patient with respect to the presence and intensity of hopelessness, psychological pain, connectedness and capacity for suicide in temporal proximity of suicide attempts and deaths by suicide. These longitudinal representations will be evaluated during aim 3 for their ability to improve existing VHA prediction models of suicide and suicide attempts, STORM (Stratification Tool for Opioid Risk Mitigation) and REACHVET (Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health - Veterans Enhanced Treatment).
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval for this study was granted by the Stanford University Institutional Review Board and the Research and Development Committee of the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. Results of the study will be disseminated through several outlets, including peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national conferences."	2022	BMJ Open
96	36001378	A Multimethod Evaluation of Tobacco Treatment Trial Recruitment Messages for Current Smokers Recently Diagnosed With Cancer: Pilot Factorial Randomized Controlled Trial.	"BACKGROUND: A cancer diagnosis can catalyze motivation to quit smoking. Tobacco treatment trials offer cessation resources but have low accrual rates. Digital outreach may improve accrual, but knowledge of how best to recruit smokers with recent diagnoses is limited.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the message frames that were most effective in promoting intent to talk to a physician about participating in a tobacco treatment trial for smokers recently diagnosed with cancer.
METHODS: From February to April 2019, current smokers diagnosed within the past 24 months were recruited from a national web-based panel for a multimethod pilot randomized trial (N=99). Participants were randomized to a 2×3 plus control factorial design that tested 3 unique message frames: proximal versus distal threats of smoking, costs of continued smoking versus benefits of quitting, and gains of participating versus losses of not participating in a tobacco treatment trial. The primary outcome was intent to talk to a physician about participating in a tobacco treatment trial. In phase 1, the main effect within each message factor level was examined using ANOVA and compared with the control condition. Other message evaluation and effectiveness measures were collected and explored in a multivariable model predicting intent to talk to a physician. In phase 2, open-text evaluations of the messages were analyzed using natural language processing software (Leximancer) to generate a thematic concept map and Linguistic Inquiry Word Count to identify and compare the prevalence of linguistic markers among message factors.
RESULTS: Of the 99 participants, 76 (77%) completed the intervention. Participants who received the cost of continued smoking frame were significantly more likely to intend to talk to their physician about participating in a tobacco treatment trial than those who received the benefits of the quitting frame (mean costs 5.13, SD 1.70 vs mean benefits 4.23, SD 1.86; P=.04). Participants who received the proximal risks of continued smoking frame were significantly more likely to seek more information about participating (mean distal 4.83, SD 1.61 vs mean proximal 5.55, SD 1.15; P=.04), and those who received the losses of not participating frame reported significantly improved perceptions of smoking cessation research (mean gain 3.98, SD 0.83 vs mean loss 4.38, SD 0.78; P=.01). Male participants (P=.006) and those with greater message relevancy (P=.001) were significantly more likely to intend to talk to their physician. Participants' perceptions of their smoking habits, as well as their motivation to quit smoking, were prevalent themes in the open-text data. Differences in the percentages of affective words across message frames were identified.
CONCLUSIONS: Multimethod approaches are needed to develop evidence-based recruitment messages for patients recently diagnosed with cancer. Future tobacco treatment trials should evaluate the effectiveness of different message frames on smoker enrollment rates.

97	36001371	Deployment of a Free-Text Analytics Platform at a UK National Health Service Research Hospital: CogStack at University College London Hospitals.	"BACKGROUND: As more health care organizations transition to using electronic health record (EHR) systems, it is important for these organizations to maximize the secondary use of their data to support service improvement and clinical research. These organizations will find it challenging to have systems capable of harnessing the unstructured data fields in the record (clinical notes, letters, etc) and more practically have such systems interact with all of the hospital data systems (legacy and current).
OBJECTIVE: We describe the deployment of the EHR interfacing information extraction and retrieval platform CogStack at University College London Hospitals (UCLH).
METHODS: At UCLH, we have deployed the CogStack platform, an information retrieval platform with natural language processing capabilities. The platform addresses the problem of data ingestion and harmonization from multiple data sources using the Apache NiFi module for managing complex data flows. The platform also facilitates the extraction of structured data from free-text records through use of the MedCAT natural language processing library. Finally, data science tools are made available to support data scientists and the development of downstream applications dependent upon data ingested and analyzed by CogStack.
RESULTS: The platform has been deployed at the hospital, and in particular, it has facilitated a number of research and service evaluation projects. To date, we have processed over 30 million records, and the insights produced from CogStack have informed a number of clinical research use cases at the hospital.
CONCLUSIONS: The CogStack platform can be configured to handle the data ingestion and harmonization challenges faced by a hospital. More importantly, the platform enables the hospital to unlock important clinical information from the unstructured portion of the record using natural language processing technology."	2022	JMIR Med Inform
98	36000822	Understanding severe asthma through small and Big Data in Spanish hospitals - PAGE Study.	"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Data on severe asthma prevalence is limited. The implementation of Electronic Health records (EHRs) offers a unique research opportunity to test machine (ML) tools in epidemiological studies. The aim was to estimate severe asthma (SA) prevalence amongst the asthmatic patients seen in hospital asthma units, using both ML and traditional research methodologies. Secondary objectives were to describe non-severe asthma (NSA) and SA patients during a follow-up period of 12 months.
METHODS: The PAGE study is a multicenter, controlled, observational study conducted in 36 Spanish hospitals and split into two phases: a first cross-sectional phase for the estimation of SA prevalence, and a second, prospective phase (3 visits in 12 months) for the follow-up and characterisation of SA and NSA patients. A sub-study with ML was included in 6 hospitals. This ML tool uses EHRead technology, which extracts clinical concepts from EHRs and standardizes them to SNOMED CT.
RESULTS: : A SA prevalence of 20.1% was obtained amongst asthma patients in Spanish hospitals, compared with 9.7% prevalence by the ML tool. The proportion of SA phenotypes and the features of followed-up patients were consistent with previous studies. The clinical predictions of patients' clinical course was unreliable, while the ML only found two predictive models with discriminatory potential to predict outcomes.
CONCLUSION: This study is the first to estimate SA prevalence, in a hospital population of asthma patients, and to predict patient outcomes using both standard and ML techniques. These findings offer relevant insights for further epidemiological and clinical research in SA."	2022	J Investig Allergol Clin Immunol
99	35999848	Enhancing georeferenced biodiversity inventories: automated information extraction from literature records reveal the gaps.	We use natural language processing (NLP) to retrieve location data for cheilostome bryozoan species (text-mined occurrences (TMO)) in an automated procedure. We compare these results with data combined from two major public databases (DB): the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Using DB and TMO data separately and in combination, we present latitudinal species richness curves using standard estimators (Chao2 and the Jackknife) and range-through approaches. Our combined DB and TMO species richness curves quantitatively document a bimodal global latitudinal diversity gradient for extant cheilostomes for the first time, with peaks in the temperate zones. A total of 79% of the georeferenced species we retrieved from TMO (	2022	PeerJ
